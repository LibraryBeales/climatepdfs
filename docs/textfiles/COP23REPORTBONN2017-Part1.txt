o The purpose of Talanoa is to share stories, build empathy and trust;  
o During the process, participants advance their knowledge through 
common understanding;

o Where do we want to go?  
o How do  we get there?

well as decision -making on the implementation of climate policies,1  
Also noting that, notwithstanding the progress made by Parties in implementing the

gender action plan in order to support the implementation of gender -related decisions and 
mandates under the UNFCCC process, which may include priority areas, key activities and 
indicators, timelines for implementation, responsible and key actors and indicative 
resource requirements for each activity, and the further elaboration of its review and 
monitoring processes,  
Also r ecalling that Parties should, when taking action to addres s climate change, 
respect, promote and consider their respective obligations on human rights as well as

 15 Annex  
  Gender  action plan  
1. By d ecision 21/CP.22, paragraph 27, the Subsidiary Body for Implementation was 
requested  to develop a gender action plan (GAP) in order to support the implementation of 
gender -related decisions and mandates in the UNFCCC process, which may include priority 
areas, key activities and indicators, timelines for implementation, responsible and key 
actors and indicative resource requirements for each activity, and to further elaborate its 
review and monitoring  processes . 
2. The GAP , created under the Lima work programme on gender, seeks to advance 
women’s full, equal and meaningful participation and promote gender -responsive climate 
policy and the mainstreaming of a gender perspective in the impl ementation of the 
Convention and the work of Parties, the secretariat, U nited Nations  entities and all 
stakeholders at all levels .  
3. Gender -responsive climate policy  requires further strengthening in all activities 
concerning adaptation, mitigation and rela ted means of implementation (finance, 
technology development and transfer , and capacity -building) as well as decision -making on 
the implementation of climate policies . The GAP recognize s the need for women to be 
represented in all aspects of the UNFCCC pro cess and the  need for gender mainstreaming 
through all relevant targets and goals in activities under the Convention as an important 
contribution to increas ing their effectiveness . 
4. The GAP recognizes that gender -related action is being progressed across al l areas 
of the Convention and with respect to the Paris Agreement. Many of the activities in the 
GAP have been the subject of action by a variety of relevant organizations and will 
continue to require further action beyond the time frame of the plan.  
5. The a ctivities in the GAP vary in terms of measurability, and Parties are at various 
stages in terms of progress on this agenda. Some actions may be afforded differing degrees 
of prioritization according to the nature and scale of the climate policies being imp lemented 
and the capacities of Parties. The GAP recognizes that climate action under the Convention 
is a Party -driven process.  
Priority areas  
6. Parties, the secretariat and relevant organizations are invited to undertake the 
activities contained in the GAP , as appropriate. The GAP sets out, in five priority areas, the 
activities that will drive the achievement of its objectives . 
A. Capacity -building, knowledge -sharing and communication  
7. The GAP seeks to enhance the understanding and expertise of stakeholders  on the 
systematic integration of gender considerations and the application of such understanding 
and expertise in the thematic areas under the Convention and the Paris Agreement and in 
policies, programmes and projects on the ground.  
B. Gender balance, p articipation and women’s leadership  
8. The GAP seeks to achieve and sustain the full, equal and meaningful participation of 
women in the UNFCCC process.  
C. Coherence  
9. The GAP seeks to strengthen the integration of gender considerations within the 
work of UNFCC C bodies, the secretariat and other United Nation entities and stakeholders 
towards the consistent implementation of gender -related mandates and activities.  FCCC/CP/2017/11/Add.1  
16  D. Gender -responsive implementation and means of implementation  
10. The GAP aims to ensure the respect,  promotion and consideration of gender equality 
and the empowerment of women in the implementation of the Convention and the Paris 
Agreement.  
E. Monitoring and reporting  
11. The GAP seeks to improve tracking in relation to the implementation of and 
reporting o n gender -related mandates under the UNFCCC.
