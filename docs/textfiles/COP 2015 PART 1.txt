2    Decision 1/CP.21  
  Adoption of the Paris Agreement  
The Conference of the Parties , 
Recalling decision 1/CP.17 on the establishment of the Ad Hoc Working Group on 
the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action,  
Also recalling  Articles 2, 3 and 4 of the Convention,  
Further  recalling  relevant decisions of the Conference of the Parties, including 
decisions 1/CP.16, 2/CP.18, 1/CP.19 and 1/CP.20,  
Welcoming  the adoption of United Nations General Assembly resolution 
A/RES/70/1, “Tran sforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”, in 
particular its goal 13, and the adoption of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the third 
International Conference on Financing for Development and the adoption of the Sendai 
Framework for D isaster Risk Reduction,  
Recognizing  that climate change represents an urgent and potentially irreversible 
threat to human societies and the planet and thus requires the widest possible cooperation 
by all countries, and their participation in an effective a nd appropriate international 
response, with a view to accelerating the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions,  
Also recognizing that deep reductions in global emissions will be required in order 
to achieve the ultimate objective of the Convention an d emphasizing  the need for urgency 
in addressing climate change,  
Acknowledging  that climate change is a common concern of humankind, Parties 
should, when taking action to address climate change, respect, promote and consider their 
respective obligations o n human rights, the right to health, the rights of indigenous peoples, 
local communities, migrants, children, persons with disabilities and people in vulnerable 
situations and the right to development, as well as gender equality, empowerment of 
women and i ntergenerational equity,   
 Also acknowledging  the specific needs and concerns of developing country Parties 
arising from the impact of the implementation of response measures and, in this regard, 
decisions 5/CP.7, 1/CP.10, 1/CP.16 and 8/CP.17,  
Emphasizing  with serious concern the urgent need to address the significant gap 
between the aggregate effect of Parties’ mitigation pledges in terms of global annual 
emissions of greenhouse gases by 2020 and aggregate emission pathways consistent with 
holding the inc rease in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre -
industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre -
industrial levels,  
Also emphasizing  that enhanced pre ‐2020 ambition can lay a solid foundation  for 
enhanced post ‐2020 ambition,  
Stressing  the urgency of accelerating the implementation of the Convention and its 
Kyoto Protocol in order to enhance pre -2020 ambition,  
Recognizing  the urgent need to enhance the provision of finance, technology and 
capacity-building support by developed country Parties, in a predictable manner, to enable 
enhanced pre -2020 action by developing country Parties,  
Emphasizing  the enduring benefits of ambitious and early action, including major 
reductions in the cost of futur e mitigation and adaptation efforts,  FCCC/CP/2015/10/Add.1  
 3 Acknowledging the need to promote universal access to sustainable energy in 
developing countries, in particular in Africa, through the enhanced deployment of 
renewable energy,  
Agreeing  to uphold and promote regional and  international cooperation in order to 
mobilize stronger and more ambitious climate action by all Parties and non -Party 
stakeholders, including civil society, the private sector, financial institutions, cities and 
other subnational authorities, local commu nities and indigenous peoples,

context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty, including by:   
(a) Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C 
above pre -industrial levels and pursu ing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C 
above pre -industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and 
impacts of climate change;  
(b) Increasing the ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and 
foster climate resilience and low greenhouse gas emission s development, in a manner that 
does not threaten food production; and  
(c) Making finance  flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas 
emission s and climate -resilient development.  
2. This Agreement will be implemented to reflect equity and the principle of common 
but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different 
national circumstances.  
Article 3  
As nationally determined contributions to the global response t o climate change, all 
Parties are to undertake and communicate ambitious efforts as defined in Articles 4, 7, 9, 
10, 11 and 13 with the view to achieving the purpose of this Agreement as set out in Article

need to support developing country Parties for the effective implementation of this 
Agreement.  
Article 4  
1. In order to achieve the long -term temperature goal set out in Article 2, Parties aim to 
reach global peakin g of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible, recognizing that 
peaking will take longer for developing country Parties, and to undertake rapid reductions 
thereafter in accordance with best available science, so as to achieve a balance between 
anthropo genic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the 
second half of this century, on the basis of equity, and in the context of sustainable 
development and efforts to eradicate poverty.  FCCC/CP/2015/10/Add.1

its highest possible ambition, reflecting its common but differentiated responsibilities and 
respective capabilities, in the light of different natio nal circumstances.  
4. Developed country Parties should continue taking the lead by undertaking economy -
wide absolute emission reduction targets. Developing country Parties should continue 
enhancing their mitigation efforts, and are encouraged to move over tim e towards 
economy -wide emission reduction or limitation targets in the light of different national 
circumstances.  
5. Support shall be provided to developing country Parties for the implementation of 
this Article, in accordance with Articles 9, 10 and 11, recognizing that enhanced support for
