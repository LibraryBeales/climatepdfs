3/CP.24, 11/CP.25, paragraph 10, 1/CP.26 and 4/CP.26,  
1. Recalls the commitment of developed country Parties, in the context of meaningful 
mitigation actions and transparency on implementation, to a goal of mobilizing jointly 
USD  100 billion per year by 2020 to address the needs of developing country Parties in 
accordance with decision 1/CP.16;  
2. Also recalls  that, in accordance with decision 1/CP.21, paragraph 53, developed 
countries reaffirmed the continuation of their existing collective mobilization goal through 
2025 in the context of meaningful mitigation action s and transparency on implementation;  
3. Notes  with de ep regret that the goal of developed country Parties to mobilize jointly 
USD 100 billion per year by 2020 in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and 
transparency on implementation has not been met, including due to challenges in mobilizing 
finance  from private sources, and welcomes  the ongoing efforts of developed country Parties 
towards achieving the goal of mobilizing jointly USD 100 billion per year;  
4. Urges  developed country Parties to fully deliver on the USD 100 billion per year goal 
urgently a nd through 2025, noting the significant role of public funds ; 
5. Welcomes  the recent pledges made to the Adaptation Fund (totalling  USD  211.6 
million), the Least Developed Countries Fund (totalling USD 70.6 million), the Special 
Climate Change Fund (totalling  USD 35.0 million) and the eighth replenishment of the 
Global Environment Facility (totalling USD 5. 3 billion and with a climate -related finance 
target of no less than 80 per cent of all funding commitments in the eighth replenishment 
period) and urges developed country Parties to fulfil their pledges on time;

the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism, the Adaptation Fund, the Least Developed 
Countries Fund and the Special Climate Change Fund;  
9. Emphasizes  the need for further efforts to e nhance access to climate finance, including 
through harmonized, simplified and direct access procedures;  
10. Requests  Parties to continue enhancing their enabling environments and policy 
frameworks to facilitate the mobilization and effective deployment of cl imate finance;1 
11. Reiterates  that the secretariat, in collaboration with the operating entities of the 
Financial Mechanism, United Nations agencies and bilateral, regional and other multilateral 
channels, will continue to explore ways and means to assist developing country Parties in  
assessing their needs and priorities in a country -driven manner, including their technological 
and capacity -building needs, and in translating climate finance needs into action;2

Taking note  of decision 14/CMA.4 , 
1. Welcomes  the 2022 report of the Standing Committee on Finance;1 
2. Also welcomes the fifth Biennial Assessment and Overview of Climate Finance Flows  
of the Standing Committee on Finance  and the summary , and takes note  of the 
recommendations contained in the annex;2 
3. Notes  that climate finance flows in 2019 –2020 were 12 per cent higher than in 
2017 –2018, reaching an annual average of USD 803 billion, driven by investments in energy 
efficiency of buildings, sustainable transport and adaptation; the 2019 –2020 annual average 
of public financial support reported by Parties included in Annex II to the Convention in their 
biennial reports (USD 40.1 billion) represents an increase of 6 per cent from the annual 
average reported for 2017 –2018; the annual average of cli mate finance from  multilateral 
development banks to developing countries and emerging economies3 (USD 45.9 billion) 
represents a  17 per cent increase since  2017 –2018; and UNFCCC funds and multilateral 
climate funds committed USD 2.9 billion and USD 3.5 bi llion for climate finance projects in 
2019 and 2020 respectively;  
4. Notes with concern that global climate finance flows are small relative to the overall 
needs of developing countries;  
5. Also notes with concern  that, despite the clear increasing trend in global climate 
finance flows, they remain at a relatively low level in the broader context of other finance 
flows, investment opportunities and costs;  
6. Encourages  Parties to the Convention to consider implement ing the recommendations 
referred to in paragraph 2 above, as appropriate;  
7. Acknowledges  the improvement in quality, transparency and granularity of 
information in the fifth Biennial Assessment while recognizing that data limitations persist, 
particularly in r elation to private climate finance, including private finance  mobilized by 
developed country Parties through bilateral and multilateral channels, and finance in sectors 
other than energy and transport, and  requests  further work in this regard in the sixth Biennial 
Assessment, including in relation to data by region, private finance mobilized from public 
interventions and financing arrangements relevant to averting, minimizing and addressing 
loss and damage;  
8. Stresse s the importance of reporting on climate finance provided, mobilized, needed 
and received at both the activity and country level, and of enhancing methodologies for 
measuring and reporting on the results and impacts of climate finance;  
9. Notes  that the work of the Standing Committee on Finance on definitions of climate 
finance4 shows the variety of definitions in use;

finance in use by Parties and non -Party stakeholders in re lation to ensuring clear , aggregated 
accounting and reporting of climate finance;  
11. Requests  the Standing Committee on Finance to prepare a report for consideration by 
the Conference of the Parties at its twenty -eighth session (November –December 2023), 
build ing on the Committee’s work on definitions of climate finance, on clustering types of 
climate finance definitions in use that could be considered within the UNFCCC process, 
including with a view to updating the Committee’s operational definition of climate  finance, 
as appropriate, and supporting Parties in their national reporting efforts and invites  Parties 
and external stakeholders to make further submissions thereon via the submission portal5 by 
30 April  2023;

Summary and recommendations of the fifth Biennial 
Assessment and Overview of Climate Finance Flows  
[English only]  
I. Context and mandates  
1. The fifth BA  conducted by the SCF1 provides an updated overview of climate finance 
flows up until 2020, highlighting the trends therein, and an assessment of the  implications of 
these flows for international efforts to address climate change. The  fifth BA includes:  
(a) Information on recent developments in methodologies related to the tracking 
of climate finance at the international and domestic level, the operational definitions of 
climate finance in use and the indicators for measuring the impacts of climate finance, as 
well as emerging methodologies that support tracking the consistency of finance flows (see 
also the box below);  
(b) An overview of climate fin ance flows from developed to developing countries, 
and available information on domestic climate finance, cooperation among developing 
countries2 and other climate -related finance flows that constitute global climate finance;  
(c) An assessment of the key fea tures of climate finance flows, including their 
composition and purpose; an exploration of the effectiveness, accessibility and magnitude (in 
the context of broader flows) of climate finance flows; and insights into country ownership 
and alignment of clima te finance flows with the needs and priorities of beneficiaries.  
2. Since the first BA was conducted in 2014, the preparation of BAs has been guided by 
mandates from the COP and the CMA to the SCF.3 The fifth BA comprises this summary, 
prepared by the SCF, and a technical report prepared by experts under the guidance of the 
SCF drawing on information and data from a range of sources. The report was subject to 
extensive stakeholder input and expert review, but remains a product of the external experts.  
Challe nges and limitations in collecting and aggregating data on climate finance  
The challenges and limitations outlined below need to be taken into consideration when 
deriving conclusions and policy implications from the fifth BA:  
(a) The fifth BA covers 2019 –2020, a period during which the coronavirus disease 2019 
pandemic may have affected the provision, mobilization and reporting of climate 
finance flows;  
(b) In compiling the estimates of climate finance flows, efforts were made to ensure 
they are based on activities that are in line with the operational definition of climate 
finance adopted in the first BA in 2014 and to avoid double counting. Challenges were

 1 The SCF assists the COP in exercising its functions with respect to the Financial Mechanism, 
including in terms of measurement, reporting and verification of support provided to developing 
country Parties t hrough activities such as the BA. The SCF also serves the Paris Agreement, in line 
with its functions and responsibilities established under the COP (as per decision 1/CP.21, para. 63), 
including through the BA.  
 2 For the purpose of the overview of climat e finance in the BA, various data sources are used to 
illustrate flows from developed to developing countries, without prejudice to the meaning of those 
terms in the context of the Convention and the Paris Agreement, including but not limited to flows 
from  Annex I Parties  and Annex II Parties to non-Annex I Parties and MDBs; flows from OECD 
members to non -members; flows from OECD Development Assistance Committee  members to 
countries eligible for OECD Development Assistance Committee  official development ass istance; and 
other relevant classifications.

 7 encountered in aggregating and analysing information from diverse sourc es with 
varying degrees of transparency;  
(c) In 2019, COP 25 changed the due date for submission of the fifth biennial reports 
of Annex I Parties (including Annex II Parties), which were to include information on 
climate finance provided to non -Annex I Pa rties in 2019 –2020, to no later than 31 
December 2022.4 Therefore, during preparation of the fifth BA, the SCF invited 
Annex  II Parties to provide preliminary data on climate finance provided and mobilized 
for 2019 and 2020. These preliminary data may be subject to change once fifth biennial 
reports are submitted by Parties by the end of 2022;  
(d) In the area of global climate finance, challenges remain in filling data gaps, 
particularly on private finance for adaptation activities and for mitigation activ ities in 
the AFOLU, the waste and the water and sanitation sectors. Methodologies for 
calculating climate finance based on total cost or incremental cost produce different 
estimates by activity. This potentially leads to limitations regarding the completen ess 
of data and any interpretation of the relative shares of global climate finance going to 
different themes or sectors. Energy efficiency estimates do not include data broken 
down by public or private actor financial instrument, or at country level. Some  data 
sources, such as those for renewable energy, provide activity -level data but may make 
country - and technology -level assumptions on finance flows to fill data gaps. In 
compiling data from various sources to aggregate global climate finance flows, 
approaches that ensure the avoidance of potential overlaps in coverage are taken;  
(e) Regarding domestic climate finance, although more countries are developing 
climate finance reporting systems, time lags in implementation mean data are 
underreported for 2019 –2020. Amounts in relation to public expenditure may refer to 
ex ante budget allocations or ex post actual expenditures. Furthermore, the climate 
relevance of activities reported may refer to weighted criteria per activity or to positive 
activity lists;  
(f) Data on international climate finance flows are compiled using various 
methodologies and have varying interpretations. Flows from developed to developing 
countries – covering finance provided, mobilized and received – include a mix of data 
based on dis bursements to projects and recipients in the given year or on financial 
commitments made in the reporting year to activities that may be implemented over 
several years. Information on South –South cooperation in climate finance flows 
remains relatively unde rreported. The classification of data such as by geographical 
region or by granularity is not uniform across data sources. As for previous BAs, for 
the fifth BA, no aggregation of data from different sources for finance flows from 
developed countries to de veloping countries was carried out owing to these 
challenges and limitations.  
The SCF will continue to contribute, through its activities, to the progressive 
improvement of the measurement, reporting and verification of climate finance in future 
BAs, to he lp address these challenges and limitations.  
II. Key findings  
A. Methodological issues related to transparency of climate finance  
3. New reporting tables will improve the information on climate finance submitted 
by Parties.  CMA 3 adopted new tables for reporting b y Parties under the Paris Agreement 
on climate finance provided to and mobilized for developing countries and climate finance 
needed and received by developing countries. The new tables will be used for reporting from 
the end of 2024 in biennial transparen cy reports. A number of improvements  will facilitate 
enhancing the granularity of data reported on climate finance (including sectoral and 
subsectoral data) and on whether the financial support also contributes to capacity -building 
or technology transfer, and will provide an option to report on grant -equivalent amounts of 
 
 4 Decision 6/CP.25, para. 3 .  FCCC/CP/2022/10/Add.2  
8  climate finance provided and mobilized. In addition, CMA 3 requested the secretariat to 
establish an interactive web portal to facilitate the availability of information on climate 
finance  reported by Parties.5 
4. The coverage and granularity of reporting on climate finance received by 
non-Annex I Parties is improving.  The proportion of BURs that include information on 
finance received rose from approximately 60 per cent in 2014 to over 97 pe r cent in 2021. A 
total of 70 Parties have provided quantitative information on climate finance received at the 
project or activity level in tabular format. More Parties are reporting details on financial 
instruments and implementing entities and on whethe r finance received is for mitigation or 
adaptation. Information that is reported the least includes that related to the use, impacts and 
results of climate finance. Limited capacities and resources to track climate finance received 
can pose challenges for non-Annex I Parties in reporting this information, and a lack of 
reporting on the year an activity received climate finance can make it difficult to compile and 
aggregate data.  
5. Systems to track domestic public climate finance are growing in both developed  
and developing countries. Twenty -four jurisdictions have established tracking systems for 
national budgets, with a further 24 countries having methodologies for tracking climate -
relevant budgets in development. Building on previous work carried out as par t of the climate 
public expenditure and institutional reviews of the United Nations Development Programme, 
many countries are developing guidance on green budgeting frameworks that include 
climate -relevant activities. Domestic public expenditures on climat e change in 2019 –2020 
amounted to an estimated total of USD 134.2 billion (see chap. II.B below).  
6. Renewable energy, CCU/S, electrified transport, energy efficiency of buildings, 
and water management and supply are the most common mitigation activities lis ted 
across international, regional and national taxonomies or classifications . An analysis of 
12 classification lists or taxonomies related to climate change mitigation activities, including 
those of MDBs and of regional and national jurisdictions, reveale d that mitigation activities 
that appear most commonly (in more than 75 per cent of lists) are renewable energy, 
electrified transport, energy efficiency of buildings, water management and supply, and 
abatement technologies (e.g. carbon dioxide capture and  use or storage). Different eligibility 
criteria are in use for common activities relating to agriculture, waste, transport infrastructure 
and power generation (the latter including geothermal power, hydropower, bioenergy and 
efficiency improvements). Less  common activities (in 25 –75 per cent of lists) include gas -
fired power generation, waste -to-energy processes, sustainable logging, and information and 
communication technology infrastructure. Of the uncommon activities (less than 25 per cent 
of lists), no table are nuclear power generation, aviation and mining. Of the 12 taxonomies of 
countries and institutions reviewed, 10 make use of exclusion lists across mitigation sectors.  
For adaptation, most taxonomies refer to process -based screening methods rather than an 
activity list owing to adaptation activities being specific to a given local environment or 
context. The evaluation baseline for adaptation screening processes is typically based on 
environmental and climate risk and vulnerability assessments or na tional, regional or global 
resilience and biodiversity standards and codes. In addition, 7 of the 12 analysed taxonomies 
apply the ‘do no significant harm’ principle (to other environmental objectives) when 
assessing the eligibility of activities.  
7. Climate finance providers are advancing more indicators and metrics to measure 
what climate finance is achieving on the ground.  Multilateral climate funds (including the 
operating entities of the Financial Mechanism), multilateral institutions and national 
develop ment finance institutions are in the process of developing or have already developed 
frameworks for measuring outputs, outcomes and impacts of climate finance interventions, 
with the granularity of indicators and metrics increasing. Multilateral climate fu nds, in their 
results management frameworks, capture information on 141 indicators, 48 of which are core 
indicators, and most multilateral institutions, as well as bilateral contributors, use a similar 
set of mitigation and adaptation indicators. Common in dicators identified for mitigation are 
greenhouse gas emissions reduced (in t CO 2 eq) and sector -specific metrics for the energy, 
transport and land -use sectors. For adaptation, common indicators in use are the number of 
 
 5 Decision 5/CMA.3.  FCCC/CP/2022/10/Add.2  
 9 beneficiaries; the hectares of land  protected; and the number of policies, projects, plans, 
systems or assets that foster climate resilience. An ongoing challenge is defining and 
reporting on outcome and impact indicators that enable the long -term or indirect effects of 
climate finance inte rventions (e.g. job creation or the increased climate resilience of 
beneficiaries ) to be captured as opposed to measuring direct project outputs (e.g. number of 
beneficiaries or number of early warning systems installed). Methodologies for outcome 
measurem ent are at earlier stages of development by climate finance providers than those for 
output measurement.  
8. Increasing efforts are being made to enhance the transparency and 
comparability of approaches for tracking consistency with low -emission and climate -
resilient development pathways. Methodological developments in this area, particularly 
from the private financial sector and supervisory authorities, are in a dynamic growth phase. 
The aim of these initiatives and efforts is to offer discussion of and guida nce on appropriate 
choices of emission pathways and scenarios, emission metrics and measures, geographical 
and sector coverage, the role of carbon offsets, the formulation and implementation of 
transition plans and governance frameworks, and aggregate Pari s Agreement alignment 
indicators. In the financial sector, a focus of current approaches on decarbonization and net 
zero targets, rather than on fostering climate change adaptation and resilience, continues to 
be observed. Since the fourth BA, initiatives that seek to increase the transparency and 
understanding of approaches for tracking consistency have emerged – notable among these 
are the United Nations High -Level Expert Group on the Net -Zero Emissions Commitments

B. Overview of climate finance flows in 2019 –2020  
9. Global climate finance flows were 12 per cent higher in 2019 –2020 than in 
2017–2018, reaching an annual average of USD  803 billion, with the trend being driven 
by an increasing number of mitigation actions in buildings and infrastructure and in 
sustainable transport, as well as by growth in adaptation finance . The growth in finance 
flows in 2019 –2020 was largely driven by increased investment in the energy efficiency of 
buildings (USD 34 b illion increase), sustainable transport (USD 28 billion increase) and 
adaptation finance (USD 20 billion increase). While overall investment in clean energy 
systems remained stable, public energy investment increased its share of total finance flows. 
Adaptation finance increased by 65 per cent, from an annual average of USD 30 billion in 
2017 –2018 to USD 49 billion in 2019 –2020, driven mainly by financing from bilateral and 
multilateral development finance institutions. Figure  1 provides a breakdown, by sec tor, of 
global climate finance flows in 2017 –2020 and figure  2 provides an overview of global 
climate finance and finance flows from developed to developing countries in 2019 –2020.

10. The continued decline in renewable energy technology costs in 2019 –2020 compared 
with those in 2017 –2018 meant that renewable energy investments, despite the economic 
slowdown caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 pand emic, remained close to the record 
high in 2017. Technology cost decreases in 2019 –2020 compared with 2018 for onshore wind 
(13 per cent), offshore wind (9 per cent) and solar photovoltaic (7 per cent) emphasized how 
greater impacts are now achieved for ea ch new dollar invested. Aggregate investments in 
new renewable energy generation projects made up the largest segment of global climate 
finance.  The declining costs of renewable energy alongside the maintenance of high levels 
of investment indicates that t he overall deployment of renewable energy technologies has 
increased in real terms.   
11. Government pandemic recovery packages included up to USD  513 billion of 
spending allocated to green or climate -related measures (21 per cent of the total 
USD  2.5 trillion)  up until the end of 2020. Approximately 76 per cent (USD  392 billion) of 
climate -related recovery spending was announced by developed countries and the remainder 
by developing countries, particularly those in Asia. Data from climate budget tagging 
systems  and other sources indicated domestic public climate finance amounted to USD  134 
billion per year in 2019 –2020, half of which was in 21 developing countries and the other 
half in 6 developed countries or jurisdictions.

finance mobilized through public interventions by developed countries; (5) Figure note (d): this includes private finance in addition to 
finance mobilized through bila teral and multilateral channels and institutions.  
12. Public climate finance flows from developed to developing countries increased 
by between 6 and 17 per cent, depending on the source, in 2019 –2020 compared with 
2017–2018 . Preliminary data from Annex II Part ies on climate -specific finance provided for 
2019 –2020 showed that it increased by 6 per cent from 2017 –2018 to USD 40.1 billion per 
year on average. Most of the climate -specific finance (79 per cent) was channelled through 
FCCC/CP/2022/10/Add.2  
12  bilateral, regional and other ch annels, with the remainder consisting of contributions or 
inflows to multilateral climate funds and multilateral financial institutions.  
13. Mitigation finance constituted the largest share of climate -specific financial support 
through bilateral, regional and  other channels, at 57 per cent (USD 17.9 billion). However, 
the share of adaptation finance continued to increase – from 20 per cent (USD 6.4 billion) in 
2017 –2018 to 28 per cent (USD  8.9 billion) in 2019 –2020 – as it grew at a higher rate than 
mitigation  finance. In 2019 –2020, adaptation finance through bilateral, regional and other 
channels grew 40 per cent while mitigation finance decreased by 13 per cent. The share of 
cross -cutting finance, which serves both mitigation and adaptation purposes,  stagnate d at 14 –
15 per cent (USD  4.4 billion and USD 4.7 billion) in 2017 –2018 and 2019 –2020, 
respectively.  
14. UNFCCC funds and multilateral climate funds approved a combined USD 2.9 billion 
and USD 3.5 billion for climate change projects in 2019 and 2020 respective ly. The annual 
average for 2019 –2020 (USD  3.2 billion) represents an increase of 21 per cent compared 
with the annual average for 2017 –2018, attributable primarily to increases in project 
approvals by the GEF Council, the GCF Board and the Clean Technology  Fund. In terms of 
inflows, the GEF raised USD  5.3 billion from 29 contributors under the GEF -8 replenishment 
in 2022 for the programming period 2022 –2026, an increase of more than 30 per cent 
compared with the amount raised under GEF -7. Under GEF -8, USD 8 52 million was 
allocated to the climate change focal area for mitigation, an increase of 6 per cent compared 
with the amount allocated under GEF -7. The Adaptation Fund registered USD 356 million 
in new pledges from 16 donors at COP 26, which is more than t riple the amount it raised in 
2020 ( USD  116 million) .  
15. MDBs provided USD  46 billion and USD  45 billion in climate finance to developing 
and emerging economies in 2019 and 2020 respectively. The annual average of USD  45.9 
billion in 2019 –2020 represents a 1 7 per cent increase compared with the 2017 –2018 amount. 
The attribution of these flows from developed to developing countries is calculated at 
USD  29.3–30.5 billion in 2019 and USD  28.2–33.2 billion in 2020.  
16. Data on private climate finance flows to develop ing countries remain challenging to 
compile and assess. There is a methodological difference between measuring private finance 
for climate action in general and measuring climate finance mobilized through public 
interventions.  With e xisting methodologies a nd approaches, tracking private finance 
mobilized by technical assistance or policy interventions is difficult. Further, data sources 
often do not specify whether private funds are sourced from private sector entities in 
developed or developing countries a nd whether these funds are received by public or private 
sector entities from developed or developing countries. OECD estimates that private climate 
finance mobilized by developed countries through bilateral and multilateral channels 
amounted to USD  14.4 b illion and USD  13.1 billion in 2019 and 2020 respectively. The 
annual average of USD  13.8 billion represents a 6 per cent decrease compared with the annual 
average of USD  14.6 billion in 2017 –2018.  
17. The increase in submissions of BURs from non -Annex I Part ies resulted in a greater 
amount of information on finance being available for the fifth BA than for previous BAs. 
However, time lags in data availability for reporting made it difficult to compile updated, 
complete information on finance received in 2019 –2020. Of the 79 Parties that had submitted 
BURs as at 30 June 2022, 28 included some information on climate finance received in 2019 
or 2020 in their reports. In total, USD  10.0 billion was reported as received for projects 
starting in 2019 and USD  1.6 bil lion for projects starting in 2020. Approximately 81 per cent 
of the 2019 amount was specified as coming from bilateral institutions in developed countries 
or multilateral institutions and 15 per cent from institutions based in developing countries; 
the or igin of the finance was unspecified for the remaining amount.  
18. Trends in South –South climate finance flows varied depending on the source of 
finance . Finance commitments from International Development Finance Club members 
based in non -OECD countries to pro jects in other non -OECD countries amounted to USD  1.7 
billion and USD  2.2 billion in 2019 and 2020 respectively, which represented a substantial 
decrease from the USD  4.1 billion committed in 2018. The Asian Infrastructure Investment 
Bank and the New Devel opment Bank continued to increase finance flows, and FCCC/CP/2022/10/Add.2  
 13 MDB -attributed financing from non -Annex II Parties increased from around USD  9.1 billion 
in 2017 –2018 to an annual average of USD  11.0 billion in 2019 –2020. Investments in 
renewable energy and sustainabl e transport projects decreased from an annual average of 
USD  3.2 billion in 2017 –2018 to USD  2.6 billion in 2019 –2020. Overall, the availability of 
data on and the coverage of climate finance flows between developing countries remain 
limited.  
C. Assessment of  climate finance flows  
19. The collective goal of jointly mobilizing USD  100 billion per year by 2020 to 
address the needs of developing countries in the context of meaningful mitigation action 
and transparency on implementation was not fully met in 2020 .7 
20. More public finance flows from developed to developing countries are for 
mitigation than for adaptation, yet adaptation finance has grown significantly through 
bilateral channels and MDBs.  In 2019 –2020, on average, mitigation had a 57 per cent share 
(USD  17.9 billion) of bilateral climate finance, a 37 per cent share (USD  1.2 billion) of 
multilateral climate fund climate finance and a 62 per cent share (USD  23.6 billion) of MDB 
climate finance, while adaptation had corresponding shares of 28, 19 and 36 per cent 
(USD  9.0 billion, USD  605 million and USD  13.8 billion respectively). Since 2017 –2018, 
adaptation finance from bilateral channels has grown by 39 per cent (USD  2.5 billion) and 
from MDBs by 48 per cent (USD  6 billion), while adaptation finance from mu ltilateral 
climate funds has remained constant. The share of public climate finance flows contributing 
to both  adaptation and mitigation from multilateral climate funds rose to 35 per cent (USD  1.1 
billion) in 2019 –2020 from 27 per cent (USD  785 million) i n 2017 –2018. When assessing 
the balance of finance between mitigation and adaptation, it is worth considering different 
approaches to measuring climate finance flows and considering whether data are adjusted by 
the financial instrument providing the resour ces. Information on face -value financial volume 
can be complemented with information on grant -based equivalent financial volume (as is 
done by the GCF to assess its mitigation and adaptation split). The number of interventions 
and information on how differ ent institutions allocate finance can also help inform 
discussions on balance.  
21. Public adaptation finance is predominantly delivered through grants while 
public mitigation finance predominantly takes the form of loans. In 2019 –2020, grants 
accounted for 57 and 99 per cent (USD  8.5 billion and USD  1.2 billion) of the face value of 
bilateral adaptation finance and of adaptation finance from multilateral climate funds 
respectively, compared with 64 and 95 per cent (USD  5.9 billion and USD  1.1 billion) 
respectiv ely in 2017 –2018. In 2019 –2020, 15 per cent of adaptation finance flowing through 
the MDBs was grant -based (USD  2.1 billion) (see figure 3). Mitigation finance remains less 
grant -based in nature, with 31 per cent of bilateral flows (USD  4.6 billion), 30 pe r cent of 
multilateral climate fund approvals (USD  865 million) and less than 5 per cent of MDB 
investments (USD  1.1 billion) taking the form of grants.

22. Reflecting their geographical and population sizes, Asia and Africa are the 
regions receiving the largest total amounts of public climate finance. Asia received the 
most climate finance for adaptation and mitigation projects and programmes from bilateral 
channels, multilateral climate funds and MDBs, with an average of 36 per cent of the total 
climate finance provided. Asia was followed by Africa (average of 27 per cent) and Latin 
America and the Caribbean (average of 16 per cent). The remainder was shared among 
developing countries of Eastern and Southern Europe and Oceania.8 On a per capita basis, 
the less populous developing country regions Oceania and Eastern and Southern Europe 
received the largest amounts of climate finance (USD  5.1–49.5 and USD  1.0–84.2 
respectively), followed by Latin America and the Caribbean (USD  0.8–10.7), Africa 
(USD  0.6–8.4) and Asia (USD  0.2–4.0). These data do not, however, consider differing costs 
for climate change solutions in different regions,  adjust for purchasing power or address  the 
relative scale of climate vulnerabilities or emission reduction potential .  
23. Support provided to the LDCs and SIDS as a proportion of overall public climate 
finance flows remained relatively stable compared with previous years . In 2019 –2020, 
funding provided to the LDCs accounted for 25 per cent of bilateral flows, 26 per cent of 
approvals from multilateral climate funds and 20 per cent of MDB climate finance. While 
bilateral channels and MDBs increased their adaptation finance commitments to the LDCs 
from 2017 –2018 to 2019 –2020, multilateral climate funds decreased their adaptation finance 
while doubling their mitigation finance from 2017 –2018 to 2019 –2020.  
24. In 2019 –2020, funding provided to the SIDS accounted for 3 per cent of bilateral 
flows,  7 per cent of approvals from multilateral climate funds and 2 per cent of MDB climate

 15 finance. International public climate finance flows to SIDS are predominantly adaptation 
focused. Grant finance plays a strong role in SIDS, ranging from 43 to 89 per ce nt across the 
channels analysed. The LDCs and SIDS have specific vulnerabilities and needs, which are 
partially reflected in the climate finance provided to them on a per capita basis. Per capita 
climate finance reached USD  3.6–16.9 for SIDS and USD  0.8–9.4 for the LDCs in 
2019 –2020 (see figure 4).  
Figure 4  
Geographical distribution of climate finance by volume and on a per capita  basis in 
2019–2020  
  
25. Between 2016 and 2020, private climate finance mobilized by developed 
countries for developing countries  through bilateral and multilateral channels totalled 
USD  66.8 billion.  Of this amount, 86 per cent was mobilized for mitigation actions, 
particularly in the energy sector (53 per cent of total mobilized finance in the five -year 
period). Private finance mo bilized for adaptation actions targeted industry, mining and 
construction. Private climate finance was mobilized through number of mechanisms, 
dominated by direct investment in companies and special purpose vehicles, which together 
accounted for 44 per cen t of the total. MDBs mobilized 57 per cent of total estimated private 
climate finance, followed by bilateral providers and multilateral climate funds. SIDS and the 
LDCs received 1 and 8 per cent respectively of total private finance mobilized.  
26. Accreditatio n to multilateral climate funds increased by 36 per cent in 
2019–2020, driven by a rising number of national and regional institutions being 
accredited; however, while national and regional accredited entities now account for 
FCCC/CP/2022/10/Add.2  
16  more than half of all accredi ted entities, they accounted for only 10 per cent of financial 
outflows in 2019 –2020.  Climate finance readiness and project preparation initiatives play a 
key role in facilitating access to climate finance. The number of partners through which 
developing c ountries can access multilateral climate funds continues to grow rapidly, driven 
by GCF accreditation. Efforts are under way to enhance access beyond national and regional 
entities, by supporting access at the local level .  
27. Interest in country platforms th at facilitate country ownership of climate finance 
flows and their alignment with national priorities is emerging.  Country ownership is a 
fundamental factor in the delivery of effective finance but is also a broad concept 
encompassing active stakeholder en gagement, links between climate policies and economic 
growth and development policies, and national spending and tracking systems for climate 
finance. Recent studies drawing on experience from development cooperation suggest that to 
be successful in stimul ating climate action, country platforms need to secure and maintain 
political will, coordinate public finance from multiple channels and harness private 
investment. Also important is that country platforms are tailored to country needs and 
priorities.  
28. Repo rted expected and actual results from climate finance providers indicate an 
increase in portfolio -level emission reductions and number of beneficiaries reached . 
Multilateral climate funds reported a combined 96.3 Mt CO 2 eq emission reductions achieved 
and 54.8 million beneficiaries reached through their interventions. Expected results from the 
portfolios of approved or currently implemented projects are orders of magnitude higher, for 
example, 1,980 Mt CO 2 eq emission reduc tions and 588 million direct and indirect 
beneficiaries in the GCF portfolio alone. While multilateral climate funds are increasing their 
transparency and reporting under their results frameworks more regularly, they face 
persistent challenges in impact me asurement, namely, that direct project output indicators are 
easier to define that outcome indicators and that reporting on actual results is largely 
dependent on the reporting capacity of implementing entities. MDBs present mitigation and 
adaptation outco mes to varying degrees against their results and impact frameworks, often 
for their entire portfolios rather than on climate -specific support, while bilateral contributors 
have differing approaches to impact reporting. In general, it takes at least several  years before 
being able to report on outcomes and impacts of approved and implemented projects 
supported by climate finance, and this time lag poses challenges for comprehensive portfolio 
impact reporting.  
29. The way in which gender issues are addressed und er the governance and 
operational frameworks of the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism and 
multilateral climate funds has improved.  However, the development of systems for 
monitoring and reporting on gender -related outcomes at the project and po rtfolio level is still 
in progress, as is the building of capacity of the operating entities to implement gender -
responsive policies. This suggests work remains to be done on strengthening gender 
mainstreaming efforts and the availability of gender -disaggr egated and other gender -related 
data to evaluate outcomes.  
30. Global climate finance flows are small relative to the overall needs of developing 
countries. Global climate finance in 2019 –2020 was estimated to be USD  803 billion. This 
amount is 31 –32 per cent of the annual investment needed for the global temperature rise to 
follow a well below 2  °C or a 1.5  °C pathway. This level of climate finance is also below 
what one would expect in the light of the investment opportunities identified and the cost of 
failure to meet climate stabilization targets.  
31. More can be done to ensure that finance flows are consistent with climate change 
objectives. Such efforts include the reform of fiscal policies, financial policies and 
regulations and the integration and managemen t of climate risk for financial decision -making 
processes by private actors and the financial sector, with care taken in all circumstances to 
manage a just and equitable transition for all.  
32. Given the scale and speed of effort needed to align finance flows with low -emission, 
climate -resilient development pathways, it is critical to consider climate finance flows within 
the context of broader finance flows (see figure 5). A sole focus on positive climate finance 
flows will be insufficient to meet the overarch ing purpose and goals of the Paris Agreement. FCCC/CP/2022/10/Add.2  
 17 This does not mean that broader finance flows must all have explicit beneficial climate 
outcomes, but it does mean that they must integrate climate risks into decision -making and 
avoid increasing the likelihood  of negative climate outcomes.

challenges, as presented in the table below.

III. Recommendations  
34. The SCF invites the COP and the CMA to consider the recommendations presented 
in chapter III.A –C below. The three sets of recommendations relate to chapter II.A –C above.  
A. Methodological issues related to climate finance  flows  
35. Recommendations on methodological issues related to climate finance flows are as follows:  
(a) Encourage  Parties to report on climate finance provided, mobilized, needed 
and received in the new common tabular format for their first biennial transparency report to 
the highest level of granularity possible, taking into account the flexibility for those countries 
that need it in the light of their capacities, in accordance with the modalities, procedures and 
guidelines of the enhanced transparency framework under the Paris Agreement, in particular 
to report annual activity -level data;  
(b) Encourage  Parties to adopt or follow green - and climate -budgeting approaches 
and improve or establish climate finance tracking systems at the domestic level to inform 
their impl ementation of nationally determined contributions and adaptation communications;  
(c) Encourage  climate finance providers and recipients to report climate finance 
provided, mobilized, needed and received at both the activity - and the country -level;  
(d) Encourage  climate finance and data providers to further improve the data and 
the methodologies necessary for tracking private finance mobilized by developed countries, 
and others in a position to do so, through technical assistance, policy support and other public 
interventions for climate action in developing countries;  
(e) Encourage  Parties and climate finance providers to enhance their 
methodologies for measuring and reporting on climate finance results and impacts;  
(f) Encourage  Parties and climate finance providers to enhance their reporting on 
the qualitative aspects of climate finan ce, including policies, approaches and other factors 
related to strong enabling environments and delivering results;  
(g) Encourage  Parties, through the enhanced transparency framework and taking 
into account the work of the SCF on definitions of climate financ e, to better track climate 
finance provided, mobilized, needed and received;  
(h) Encourage  climate finance providers and data aggregators, in keeping with 
social inclusion and the potential value of information and data from the informal private

  Second periodic review of the long-term global goal under the 
Convention and of overall progress towards achieving it  
The Conference of the Parties ,  
Recalling Articles 2 –3 of the Convention,  
Also recalling that, pursuant to decision 1/CP.16, paragraph 138, the second periodic 
review of the long -term global goal under the Convention and of overall progress towards 
achieving it should be conducted in the light of the ultimate objective of the Convention and 
in accordance with the relevant principles and provisions of the Convention , 
Further recalling decisions 1/CP.16, paragraphs 138 –139, 1/CP.17, paragraph 6 , 
2/CP.17, paragraphs 157 –167, 1/CP.18, paragraphs 79 –91, 10/CP.21 , 18/CP.23 , 5/CP.25 and  
1/CP.26,  
1. Welcomes  the work under  the structured expert dialogue on the second periodic 
review of the long -term global goal under the Convention and of overall progress towards 
achieving it (hereinafter  referred to as the structured expert dialogue) , which contributed to 
completing the phases of the second periodic review reflected in decision 2/CP.17, paragraph 
164, and takes note  of the synthesis report thereon,1 including the 10 key messages 
highlighted therein, and the summary reports on the meetings of the dialogu e;2 
2. Expresses its appreciation and gratitude  to those involved in the structured expert 
dialogue, in particular its co -facilitators;  
3. Also expresses its appreciation and gratitude  for all the inputs  provided to the second 
periodic review , including those m ade to  the structured expert dialogue by the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the secretariat, UNFCCC constituted bodies , 
and other United Nations bodies and organizations and the report of the 2020 round table on 
pre-2020 implementation and ambi tion; 
4. Notes that work under the structured expert dialogue has been completed , as described 
in decision 1/CP.18, paragraphs 86 –89, and that the dialogue covered  the two themes of the 
second periodic review, as set out in decision 5/CP.25, paragraph 4 (a–b); 
5. Reaffirms the long -term global goal of holding the increase in global average 
temperature to well below 2 °C above pre -industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the 
temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre -industrial levels  (hereina fter referred to as the long -
term global goal) , recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of 
climate change, as referred to in decision 10/CP.21, paragraph 4, and notes  that it is assessed 
over a period of decades;   
6. Expresses a larm and utmost concern that human activities have caused a global 
average temperature increase of around 1.1  °C above pre -industrial levels to date and that 
impacts are already being felt in every region and will escalate with every increment of global 
warming;  
7. Recalls that the impacts of climate change will be much lower at the temperature 
increase of 1.5 °C compared with 2 °C3 and acknowledges  that limiting the global average 
temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre -industrial levels with no or limited overshoot would 
avoid increasingly severe climate change impacts, stressing that the severity of impacts will 
be reduced with every increment of global warming avoided;   
8. Reaffirms  that limiting  global warming to 1.5 °C requires rapid, deep and sustained 
reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions, including reducing global carbon dioxide

 41 emissions by 45 per cent by 2030 relative to the 2010 level and to net zero around mid -
century as well as deep reductions in other greenhouse gas emissions;4  
9. Notes that information and knowledge have improved significantly since the first 
periodic review (2013 –2015), while there continue to be important information and 
knowledge gaps in relation to the areas covered within the scope of the second periodic 
review set out in decision 5/CP.25, paragraph 4, and  encourages the scientific community to 
address these gaps;  
10. Notes that the Synthesis Report of the Sixth Assessment Report of the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is expected to be completed by March 2023 and 
invites  the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to present the findings therein at the 
fifty-eighth session of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (June 
2023);  
11. Notes that it is still possible to achieve the long -term global go al with immediate, 
rapid, deep and sustained reductions in overall aggregated global greenhouse gas emissions,  
while recognizing that there are challenges relating to mitigation, adaptation, and means of 
implementation and support;  
12. Also notes  that current policies and measures are insufficient for achieving the long -
term global goal and the window of opportunity for achieving the goal is closing;  
13. Further notes that valuable information was provided during the structured expert 
dialogue on how Parties can ef fect transformational change across key systems and sectors;  
14. Underscores  the need to pursue anticipatory, incremental and transformative 
adaptation and address the factors underlying increasing vulnerability and risks, including 
lack of capacity to respond  to climate change, and that most adaptation to date has been 
incremental, with little evidence of transformative adaptation, and tracking progress of 
adaptation planning remains difficult;  
15. Notes  that, despite overall progress on mitigation , adaptation and  means of 
implementation and support, Parties are  not collectively  on track  to achiev e the long-term 
global goal and that the pre-2020 pledges of some Parties and their subsequent  
implementation have been insufficient;  
16. Also notes  that there are still signi ficant gaps between collectively pledged emission 
reductions and the reductions required to achieve the long -term global goal, as well as gaps 
in support for adaptation and means of implementation  for developing country Parties , 
especially those that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, as 
provided for in the Convention;  
17. Acknowledges that, in order to shift to and remain on a pathway to achieving the long -
term global goal, Parties must enhance their efforts under the Co nvention and the Paris 
Agreement to significantly reduce their aggregated emissions prior to 2030, while recognizing 
the financial, technological, economic, capacity -building and institutional challenges and needs 
and special circumstances of developing co untry Parties, especially those that are particularly 
vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, as provided for in the Convention;  
18. Notes that, although some progress has already been made by the UNFCCC, its 
constituted bodies and other entities in scaling up financial, technological and capacity -
building support, these enablers  for climate action are not yet aligned with the urgency of a 
rapid, just and equitable low -emission and climate -resilient transition and significant gaps 
still exist in te rms of both the scale and the speed of such progress;  
19. Recognizes that climate finance has increased since the first periodic review but is  still 
inadequate to address the needs and priorities, reiterates that developed country Parties 
provide enhanced supp ort, including through financial resources, technology transfer and 
capacity -building, to assist developing country Parties with respect to both mitigation and 
adaptation, in continuation of their existing obligations under the Convention, and 
encourages  other Parties to provide or continue to provide such support voluntarily;  
 
 4 Decision 1/CP.26, para. 17.  FCCC/CP/2022/10/Add.2  
42  20. Notes  that Parties have different responsibilities, national circumstances and 
capabilities to contribute to achieving the long -term global goal, while the impacts and risks 
associated with warming are unevenly distributed, and in this regard also notes  the nee d for 
enhanced efforts towards achieving the long -term global goal, taking into account ambition, 
equity, just transition and the best available science;  
21. Further notes that the outputs of the structured expert dialogue could serve as input 
to the first glo bal stocktake, pursuant to decision 19/CMA.1, paragraph 37(c), as well as other 
relevant processes under the Convention and the Paris Agreement;  
22. Decides to consider the continuation of periodic reviews at its twenty -ninth session
