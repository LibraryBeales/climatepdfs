Opening of the session ||(Agenda item 1) ||The eighth part of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban |1. |Platform  for  Enhanced  Action  (ADP)  was  held  at  the  Palais  des  Nations,  Geneva, |Switzerland, from 8 to 13 February 2015.1 ||The  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP,  Mr.  Ahmed  Djoghlaf  (non-Annex  I)  and  Mr.  Daniel |2. |Reifsnyder (Annex I), resumed the second session of the ADP  by opening its 15th plenary |meeting on 8 February 2015. They welcomed all Parties and observers as well as Ms. Yang |Liu (non-Annex I), Rapporteur of the ADP.2 ||A  statement  was  made  by  Mr.  Manuel  Pulgar-Vidal  (Peru),  President  of  the |3. |twentieth  session  of  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  (COP)  and  the  tenth  session  of  the |Conference  of  the  Parties  serving  as  the  meeting  of  the  Parties  to  the  Kyoto  Protocol |(CMP). ||The  Co-Chairs  informed  Parties  of  the  meetings  and  consultations  they  had  held |4. |with negotiating groups prior to the session, and voiced confidence that the promises made |at  the  United  Nations  Climate  Change  Conference  held  in  Lima,  Peru,  would  be |collectively fulfilled, including by concluding an ambitious and universal agreement at the |United Nations Climate Change Conference to be held in in Paris, France. ||5. |In  the  interest  of  fulfilling  the  mandate  given  in  decision  1/CP.17,  the  Co-Chairs |encouraged Parties to convert the ‘elements’ text that emerged from the  Lima Conference |into  the  negotiating  text  that  would  furnish  the  basis  for  work  in  2015  by  Friday,  13 |February. ||6. |Statements  were submitted by representatives of 14 Parties, including on behalf of |the  Group of 77 and  China, the European Union and its 28  member States, the Umbrella |Group, the Environmental Integrity Group, the African Group, the Alliance of Small Island |States, the least developed countries, the BASIC countries (Brazil, China, India and South |Africa),  the  Like-minded  Developing  Countries,  the  Coalition  for  Rainforest  Nations,  the |Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America – Peoples’ Trade Treaty, the League of |Arab  States,  the  Independent  Association  for  Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean  and  the |Caribbean Community.3 ||7. |Parties  demonstrated  great  initiative  and  a  spirit  of  cooperation  by  opting  to  post |their  group  statements  on  the  web  rather  than  reading  them  aloud,  thereby  allowing  the |work on substantive issues to start immediately.4 ||1  The report on the first and second parts of the second session of the ADP is contained in document |FCCC/ADP/2013/2; the reports on the third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh parts of the second |session are contained in documents FCCC/ADP/2013/3, FCCC/ADP/2014/1, FCCC/ADP/2014/2, |FCCC/ADP/2014/3 and FCCC/ADP/2014/4, respectively. ||2  The Bureau of the ADP was elected in accordance with the arrangement set out in document ||FCCC/ADP/2012/2, paragraph 7, which was endorsed by decision 2/CP.18. The ADP elected the |current members of its Bureau at the seventh part of its second session, as reflected in document |FCCC/ADP/2014/4. ||3  All the statements are available at <http://unfccc.int/7544.php>.  |4  As footnote 3 above.  ||2 || |                                                           | | | | |FCCC/ADP/2015/2 ||II.  Organizational matters ||(Agenda item 2) ||A.  Adoption of the agenda ||(Agenda item 2(b)) ||The  agenda  for  the  second  session  of  the  ADP  was  adopted  by  the  ADP  at  the  1st ||8. |meeting of the session, on 29 April 2013.5 ||B.  Organization of the work of the session ||(Agenda item 2(c)) ||At the 15th meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the delegates’ attention to the scenario note |9. |prepared for the eighth part of the session,6 and outlined the arrangements made in the light |of  the  organization  of  work  previously  agreed  by  the  ADP,  the  mandates  of  the  ADP, |including those given at COP 197 and 20,8 and pre-sessional consultations. The organization |of the work on agenda item 3 included a contact group established at the fourth part of the |session,9 a briefing on support for domestic preparations for intended nationally determined |contributions  (INDCs)  and  a  dedicated  meeting  on  ways  and  means  to  advance  the |technical  examination  process  in  2015.  The  ADP  decided  to  proceed  on  the  basis  of  the |organization of work proposed by the Co-Chairs. ||10.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  stressed  the  importance  of  time  management |and of collaboration among Parties for the success of the collective work at this session.  ||11. |In  addition,  the  Co-Chairs  held  a  special  event  with  observer  organizations  during |the session, on 12 February.10 Representatives of observer organizations welcomed the new |ADP Co-Chairs, and expressed interest in continuing such special events in 2015. The ADP |Co-Chairs  underscored  the  intergovernmental  nature  of  the  ADP  and  its  work,  and |encouraged  observer  organizations  to  bring  forward  ideas  to  governments  for  further |engaging in the process and strengthening implementation. ||III.  Implementation of all the elements of decision 1/CP.17 ||(Agenda item 3) ||The  ADP  considered  this  agenda  item  at  its  15th  meeting,  as  well  as  at  its  16th |12. |meeting, held on 13 February. It had before it decision 1/CP.20, the report of the ADP on |the seventh part of its second session,11 and the informal note prepared for the eighth part of |the session.12 ||13.  At  the  15th  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  recalled  that  the  COP  requested  the  ADP  to |intensify its work with a view to making available a negotiating text for a protocol, another |legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to ||5  FCCC/ADP/2013/2, paragraphs 8 and 9. |6  ADP.2015.1.InformalNote. |7  Decision 1/CP.19. |8  Decision 1/CP.20. |9  FCCC/ADP/2014/1, paragraph 19. |10  See ADP.2015.1.InformalNote, paragraph 19. |11  FCCC/ADP/2014/4. |12  ADP.2015.1.InformalNote. ||3 || | | | | |                                                           | | | | | | | | |FCCC/ADP/2015/2 ||all  Parties  before  May  2015.13  The  Co-Chairs  reminded  Parties  that  this  negotiating  text |was  to  be  derived  from  the  annex  to  decision  1/CP.20,  titled  “Lima  Call  for  Climate |Action.” They noted that this text was to fully reflect the positions of all Parties. ||In accordance with this deadline, the Co-Chairs stressed their commitment to deliver |14. |and make available the negotiating text of the 2015 agreement by the closing plenary, on 13 |February. ||The Co-Chairs called upon the ADP to streamline the text’s language and eliminate |15. |redundancies  and  duplications,  better  present  alternatives  and  divergences,  and  clarify,  to |the extent possible, proposals and concepts contained therein. ||16. |In the interest of further refining the text over the course of future sessions, the Co-|Chairs  encouraged  Parties  to  consider  what  language  in  the  existing  text  might  be  most |suitable  for  the  agreement,  and  what  might  be  more  appropriate  for  accompanying |decisions. ||17. |The  ADP  worked  sequentially  through  the  language  of  the  annex  to  decision |1/CP.20 in an effort to develop the negotiating text. Each section was updated and further |revised as requested by Parties, in an open and transparent manner.  Each revised iteration |of the text was made available on the UNFCCC website. On 12 February, the sections were |consolidated into a single document and made available as an advance unedited version on |the UNFCCC website.14 ||18. |Further, in the context of its work on agenda item 3, the contact group referred to in |paragraph  9  above  held  meetings  to  explore  broader  substantive  questions  related  to  the |2015 agreement and ideas on how to make significant progress in the June session.15 The |Co-Chairs informed Parties of their intention to issue a scenario note in order to facilitate |preparations for that June session. ||19. |In  the  context  of  work  on  pre-2020  climate  action,  including  on  how  to  further |advance workstream 2, the contact group exchanged views on how to implement decision |1/CP.19,  in  particular  paragraphs  3–5,  and  decision  1/CP.20,  in  particular  paragraphs  17–|20.  The  ADP  held  a  dedicated  meeting  on  how  to  advance  the  technical  examination |process on 10 February.16  ||20.  At  the  16th  meeting,  the  ADP  had  before  it  the  advance  unedited  version  of  the |negotiating text, referred to in the last sentence of paragraph 17 above, and agreed that this |text accurately reflects the proposals of all Parties and is the negotiating text that the ADP |will use to start substantive negotiations at its next session. ||Following ||the  COP  mandate, ||the  Co-Chairs  requested ||to |21. |communicate  the  negotiating  text,  referred  to  in  paragraph  17  above,  to  Parties  in |accordance  with  provisions  of  the  Convention  and  the  draft  rules  of  procedure  being |applied, while noting that such communication will not prejudice whether the outcome will |be  a  protocol,  another  legal  instrument  or  an  agreed  outcome  with  legal  force  under  the |Convention applicable to all Parties.17 ||the  secretariat ||22.  Also  at  the  16th  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  provided  information  on  the  briefing  on |support  for  domestic  preparations  for  INDCs  facilitated  by  Mr.  Roberto  Dondisch |Glowinski  (Mexico).18  In  the  light  of  the  invitation  to  all  Parties  to  communicate  their ||13  Decision 1/CP.20, paragraph 6. |14  <http://unfccc.int/8862.php>. |15  See <http://unfccc.int/8843.php>. |16  See <http://unfccc.int/8804.php>. |17  Decision 1/CP.20, paragraph 7. |18  See <http://unfccc.int/8803.php>. ||4 ||                                                           | | | | | | |FCCC/ADP/2015/2 ||INDCs well in advance of COP 21 (by the first quarter of 2015 by those Parties ready to do |so),19 the objective of the briefing, which took place on 9 February, was to update Parties on |progress  in  delivering  existing  support  and  to  inform  Parties  of  other,  new  sources  of |support for the preparation of INDCs. ||23.  At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs recalled that the ADP agreed to hold at least one |additional session in the second half of 2015.20 The Co-Chairs requested the secretariat to |make the necessary arrangements to organize two additional five-day sessions in the second |half  of  the  year  in  Bonn,  Germany,  from  31  August  to  4  September  and  from  19  to  23 |October 2015. ||24. |The  Co-Chairs  invited  the  secretariat  to  provide  delegates  with  information  on  the |administrative  and  financial  implications  of,  and  on  the  status  of  funding  for,  additional |sessions of the ADP in 2015. The Executive Secretary informed Parties that the secretariat |has secured a venue for the two additional sessions of the ADP and that a total of USD 2 |million was still needed for these sessions. ||Statements  were  made  on  behalf  of  the  Presidency  of  COP  20/CMP  10  and  on ||25. |behalf of the European Union and its 28 member States. ||IV.

At  the  same  meeting,  Parties  agreed  that  an  additional  tool  was  needed  for  the |preparations  for  the  tenth  part  of  the  session.  They  requested  the  Co-Chairs,  with  the |support  of  the  secretariat  and  the  co-facilitators,  to  make  available  to  Parties  “a  single |document based on the structure of annex II to the scenario note of 5 May 2015, guided by |the  views  expressed  by  Parties  during  the  8  June  stocktaking  meeting,  taking  fully  into |account  the  discussions  in  the  75  meetings  of  the  ADP  negotiating  groups  as  well  as  the |facilitation  groups.  It  will  include  a  fully  streamlined,  consolidated,  clear  and  concise |version of the Geneva negotiating text27 that will present clear options and will not omit or |delete  any  option  or  position  of  Parties.  It  will  separate  paragraphs  of  the  Geneva |negotiating text that are, by their nature, obviously appropriate for inclusion in a draft COP |decision from paragraphs that are, by their nature, obviously appropriate for inclusion in the |Paris  agreement.  Issues  clearly  requiring  further  substantive  negotiation  among  Parties  to |determine  their  placement  will  remain  in  the  streamlined,  consolidated,  clear  and  concise |Geneva negotiating text without inclusion in either category and will be clearly identified.” |In  order  to  further  advance  the  negotiations  on  workstream  2,  the  Co-Chairs  will  also ||19  <http://unfccc.int/8987.php>. |20  <http://unfccc.int/8857.php>. |21  <http://unfccc.int/8987.php>. |22  See <http://unfccc.int/8895.php>. |23  See <http://unfccc.int/8896.php>. |24  See <http://unfccc.int/files/bodies/awg/application/pdf/adp2-|9_briefing_points_from_sbi_chair20150604_final.pdf>. |25  See <http://unfccc.int/files/bodies/awg/application/pdf/adp2-|9_briefing_points_from_sbsta_chair20150604_final.pdf>. ||26  Available at <http://unfccc.int/8857.php>. |27   FCCC/ADP/2015/1. ||4 || |                                                           | | | | | | | | | |FCCC/ADP/2015/3 ||prepare a document with elements for a draft decision on workstream 2 of the ADP as a key |piece of the package to be considered at the Paris Conference.  ||17. |The  Co-Chairs  invited  the  secretariat  to  provide  delegates  with  information  on  the |administrative  and  budgetary  implications  of,  and  on  the  status  of  funding  for,  holding |additional sessions of the ADP in 2015. The Deputy Executive Secretary informed Parties |that  there  is  an  outstanding  requirement  of  EUR  3.1  million  that  need  to  be  secured  in  a |timely  manner  in  order  to  enable  the  participation  of  representatives  of  eligible  Parties  at |the remaining sessions of the ADP and the COP in 2015. The Parties were further informed |that EUR 100,000 is still required to complete the financing of the logistical arrangements |for the October session of the ADP. ||18. |Closing statements were made on behalf of the Presidency of COP 20/CMP 10 and |the  incoming  Presidency  of  COP  21/CMP  11.  In  addition,  three  Parties  made  statements |available on the UNFCCC website, including on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, the |European Union and its 28 member States and the African Group.28 ||IV.

At  its  18th  meeting,  the  ADP  considered  and  adopted  the  draft  report  on  the  ninth |part of its second session.29 At the same meeting, on a proposal of the Co-Chairs, the ADP |authorized the Rapporteur to complete the report on the  ninth part of the session, with the |assistance of the secretariat and under the guidance of the Co-Chairs. ||V.  Suspension of the session ||20.  At its 18th meeting, the ADP agreed on a proposal of the Co-Chairs to suspend the |second session and resume it in August 2015 in Bonn at its tenth part. ||21.

Opening of the session ||(Agenda item 1) ||1. |The seventh part of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban |Platform  for  Enhanced  Action  (ADP)  was  held  at  the  United  Nations  Climate  Change |Conference, Lima, Peru, from 2 to 13 December 2014.1 ||2. |The  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP,  Mr.  Kishan  Kumarsingh  (non-Annex  I)  and  Mr. Artur |Runge-Metzger (Annex I), resumed the second session and opened the 13th plenary meeting |on 2 December. They welcomed all Parties and observers. They also welcomed Ms. Anna |Serzysko (Annex I) as Rapporteur of the ADP.2 ||3. |The  Co-Chairs  stressed  the  need  for  the  ADP  to  provide  to  the  Conference  of  the |Parties (COP) a clear and solid foundation for the new global climate change agreement to |be  adopted  at  COP  21,  which  would  signal  to  the  world  the  determination  of  Parties  to |deliver  a  successful  outcome  at  that  session  of  the  COP,  to  be  held  in  Paris,  France. The |Co-Chairs reminded delegates of the need to identify the information that will be provided |in relation to the intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) in accordance with |decision 1/CP.19 and called for the strengthening and acceleration of climate action prior to |2020 through a decision that was to be considered and adopted at COP 20. ||4. |Statements  were  made  by  representatives  of  13  Parties,  including  on  behalf  of  the |Group  of  77  and  China,  the  European  Union  and  its  28  member  States,  the  Umbrella |Group, the Environmental Integrity Group, the African Group, the Alliance of Small Island |States,  the  least  developed  countries  (LDCs),  the  Independent  Association  for  Latin |America and the Caribbean (AILAC), the Central American Integration System, the League |of  Arab  States,  the  BASIC  countries  (Brazil,  China,  India  and  South  Africa),  the  Like-|minded  Developing  Countries  and  the  Coalition  for  Rainforest  Nations.  In  addition, |statements  were  made  on  behalf  of  environmental  non-governmental  organizations |(NGOs), farmers NGOs, indigenous peoples organizations, local government and municipal |authorities,  trade  union  NGOs,  women  and  gender  NGOs,  youth  NGOs  and  business  and |industry NGOs.  ||II.  Organizational matters ||(Agenda item 2) ||A.  Election of officers |(Agenda item 2(a)) ||The  ADP  considered  this  sub-item  at  its  14th  meeting,  on  13  December.  The  Co-|5. |Chairs reported that the consultations on the  election of the  Bureau of the  ADP had been |successfully concluded.  ||1  The report on the first and second parts of the second session of the ADP is contained in document |FCCC/ADP/2013/2; the reports on the third, fourth, fifth and sixth parts of the second session are |contained in documents FCCC/ADP/2013/3, FCCC/ADP/2014/1, FCCC/ADP/2014/2 and |FCCC/ADP/2014/3, respectively. ||2  The Bureau of the ADP was elected in accordance with the arrangement set out in document ||FCCC/ADP/2012/2, paragraph 7, which was endorsed by decision 2/CP.18. The ADP elected the |current members of its Bureau at the second and third parts of its second session, as reflected in |documents FCCC/ADP/2013/2, paragraph 6, and FCCC/ADP/2013/3, paragraph 5, respectively. ||2 || | | | |                                                           | | |FCCC/ADP/2014/4 ||6. |On  a  proposal  of  the  Co-Chairs,  the  ADP  elected  by  acclamation  Mr.  Ahmed |Djoghlaf  (non-Annex  I)  and  Mr.  Daniel  Reifsnyder  (Annex  I)  as  its  Co-Chairs  and  Ms. |Yang Liu (non-Annex I) as its Rapporteur. ||B.  Adoption of the agenda ||(Agenda item 2(b)) ||The  agenda  for  the  second  session  of  the  ADP  was  adopted  by  the  ADP  at  the  1st ||7. |meeting of the session, on 29 April 2013.3  ||C.  Organization of the work of the session ||(Agenda item 2(c)) ||At  the  13th  meeting,  on  2  December,  the  Co-Chairs  drew  the  attention  of  the |8. |delegates to the scenario note prepared for the seventh part of the session,4 and outlined the |arrangements made in the light of the organization of work previously agreed by the ADP, |the  mandates  of  the  ADP,  including  those  given  at  COP  19,5  and  pre-sessional |consultations.  The  organization  of  the  work  on  agenda  item  3  included  a  contact  group |established at the fourth part of the session.6  ||9. |At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs stressed the importance of optimizing the use of |the limited time available and informed the ADP of the greater efforts on time management |undertaken  by  the  Chairs  of  the  subsidiary  bodies  in  consultation  with  the  Bureau  of  the |COP and the negotiating groups to strengthen inclusivity, discipline, respect and fairness. ||In addition, the Co-Chairs informed Parties of their intention to hold a special event ||10. |with observers during the session. This event took place on 5 December. ||III.  Implementation of all the elements of decision 1/CP.17 ||(Agenda item 3) ||1.  Proceedings ||The ADP considered this item at its 13th meeting, as well as at its 14th meeting, on |11. |13  December.  It  had  before  it  documents  FCCC/ADP/2014/3,  FCCC/ADP/2014/L.4, |FCCC/ADP/2014/L.5,  FCCC/ADP/2014/CRP.4  and  FCCC/2014/TP/13  and  Add.1–4,  as |well as the informal notes prepared for the seventh part of the session.7 ||12.  At the 13th meeting, the Co-Chairs recalled the establishment of the contact group on |item 3, referred to in paragraph  8 above, and its  mandate  to  work in accordance  with the |agreed  agenda  and  established  UNFCCC  practice.  They  also  recalled  the  core  principles |guiding the work of the ADP, namely that the process will continue to be Party-driven and |build  on  inputs  from  Parties,  and  that  any  outputs  of  the  process  will  reflect  inputs  from |Parties.  ||13.  At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the attention of delegates to the informal |documents prepared by the Co-Chairs and aimed at supporting delegates by providing focus ||3  FCCC/ADP/2013/2, paragraphs 8 and 9. |4  ADP.2014.10.InformalNote. |5  Decision 1/CP.19. |6  FCCC/ADP/2014/1, paragraph 19. |7  The informal notes are listed in annex II. ||3 || | | | | |                                                           | | | | | |FCCC/ADP/2014/4 ||to the negotiations and capturing the progress made by the ADP as well as the submissions |received, namely: ||(a) ||A non-paper on elements for a draft negotiating text updating the earlier non-||paper;8 ||(b)  A  draft  decision  text  on  advancing  the  Durban  Platform  for  Enhanced ||Action.9 ||The  Co-Chairs  underlined  the  need  to  continue  the  consideration  and  further |14. |elaboration of the elements for a draft negotiating text with a view to making a negotiating |text available before May 2015, in line with the  mandates contained in decisions 2/CP.18 |and  1/CP.19.  The  Co-Chairs  also  stressed  the  need  for  the  ADP  to  consider  how  to  take |forward its work on the elements, and how to forward the results of this work to 2015.  ||15. |In  addition,  the  Co-Chairs  informed  the  ADP  of  the  calls  from  Parties  for  textual |negotiations.  In  this  context,  the  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to  make  specific |suggestions that seek to build bridges and clarify options so as to allow the contact group to |collectively  advance  its  work  towards  a  draft  negotiating  text.  In  the  light  of  the  limited |time  available  to  the  ADP  to  advance  this  work,  the  Co-Chairs  proposed  that  focused |negotiations in the contact group on the elements for a draft negotiating text be undertaken |in parallel and facilitated by either one of the Co-Chairs.  ||16.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  recalled  the  work  undertaken  by  the  ADP  on |draft decision texts on the identification of the information that Parties  will provide when |putting forward their INDCs and on accelerating the implementation of enhanced pre-2020 |climate action. The Co-Chairs proposed that the contact group continue its work on these |issues  through  textual  negotiations  with  a  view  to  agreeing  on  a  draft  decision  to  be |recommended for consideration and adoption at COP 20.  ||17. |The Co-Chairs further drew the attention of delegates to the updated technical paper |titled “Updated compilation of information on the mitigation benefits of actions, initiatives |and options to enhance mitigation ambition”,10 prepared by the secretariat as requested by |the  ADP  at  the  third  part  of  its  second  session.11  The  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to |read  the  updated  technical  paper  and  to  bring  it  to  the  attention  of  the  relevant |implementation officials in their respective governments.  ||18. |In  the  context  of  pre-2020  action,  the  Co-Chairs  also  informed  the  ADP  of  their |request to the secretariat to cluster and enhance the visibility of side events and exhibits in |Lima  that  were  directly  relevant  to  the  thematic  areas  explored  by  the  technical  expert |meetings in 2014, and that further information on these events and exhibits was available |on the UNFCCC website.12 ||19.  At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the attention of delegates to the high-level |ministerial  dialogue  on  climate  finance  and  the  high-level  ministerial  dialogue  on  the |Durban  Platform  for  Enhanced  Action,  which  were  to  be  held  on  9  and  10  December, |respectively.  They  expressed  their  appreciation  to  Mr.  Manuel  Pulgar-Vidal,  President  of |COP 20 and the tenth session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the |Parties to the Kyoto  Protocol (CMP), and his team  for the great efforts  made to facilitate |the ADP process. ||8  ADP.2014.11.NonPaper. |9  ADP.2014.12.DraftText. |10  FCCC/TP/2014/13 and Add.1–4.  |11  FCCC/ADP/2013/3, paragraph 30(c)(ii). |12  <http://unfccc.int/bodies/awg/items/8682.php>.  ||4 || | |                                                           | | | | | | | |FCCC/ADP/2014/4 ||20. |The  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to  attend  the  numerous  briefings,  forums  and |events  on  areas  of  relevance  to  the  work  of  the  ADP  being  held  in  Lima  and  informed |delegates that a list of these events was available on the UNFCCC website.13 ||21.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  ADP  agreed  to  the  proposals  by  the  Co-Chairs  on  the |organization of work by the ADP on item 3.  ||22. |The  ADP  met  on  6  December  to  take  stock  of  progress  made  and  to  consider  the |possible way forward. Further to this informal meeting and in response to an invitation by |the President of COP 20/CMP 10, on 8 December the Co-Chairs issued a revised version of |the draft decision text referred to in paragraph 16 above and of the draft text containing the |elements  for  a  draft  negotiating  text.  At  the  request  of  Parties,  a  compilation  of  textual |inputs received from Parties14 was made available on the UNFCCC website.15 ||23. |Following the stocktaking meeting and the issuance of the draft texts referred to in |paragraph  22  above,  the  ADP  further  focused  its  work,  including  through  line-by-line |negotiations  on  the  draft  decision  text  on  agenda  item  3.  The  progress  of  this  work  was |captured in: ||(a) ||A  revised  version  of  the  draft  text  containing  the  elements  for  a  draft ||negotiating text, issued on 10 December;  ||(b) ||Revised  versions  of  the  draft  decision  text  on  agenda  item  3  reflecting  the |status  of  the  negotiations,  made  available  on  the  UNFCCC  website  on  9,  10  and  11 |December.16 ||24. |Progress was also reflected in the oral reports by the ADP Co-Chairs to the informal |stocktaking  plenaries  convened  by  the  President  of  COP 20/CMP 10  on  10,  11  and  12 |December. ||25. |In  addition  to  the  consultations  with  Parties  undertaken  by  the  President  of |COP 20/CMP  10  and  the  ongoing  ADP  negotiations,  on  12  December  the  President |launched  ministerial  consultations  on  ADP  issues  facilitated  on  his  behalf  by  ministers |Vivian Balakrishnan (Singapore) and Tine Sundtoft (Norway) with a view to facilitating a |successful outcome of the ADP process. ||26.  On 13 December, the Co-Chairs convened an informal ADP meeting to introduce a |further revised draft decision on agenda item 3 with an annex containing the elements for a |draft negotiating text referred to in paragraph 23(a) above.17 ||27.  On  the  same  day,  the  Co-Chairs  opened  the  14th  plenary  meeting  and  invited  the |ADP to consider the draft decision referred to in paragraph 26 above.  ||28.  At  the  beginning  of  the  meeting,  the  President  of  COP 20/CMP 10  recalled  the |expectations for a successful outcome of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in |Lima,  which  would  provide  a  solid  foundation  for  reaching  an  agreement  in  Paris.  The |President  called  for  flexibility  and  encouraged  Parties  to  work  together  to  achieve  the |successful outcome needed.  ||29. |Statements  were  made  by  representatives  of  41  Parties,  including  on  behalf  of  the |Environmental Integrity Group, the African Group, the European Union and its 28 member |States,  the  LDCs,  AILAC,  the  Like-minded  Developing  Countries,  the  League  of  Arab |States and the BASIC countries. ||13  <http://unfccc.int/files/bodies/awg/application/pdf/lima_conference_adp_relevant_events.pdf>. |14  <http://unfccc.int/bodies/awg/items/8757.php>. |15  <http://unfccc.int/files/bodies/awg/application/pdf/compilation_of_inputs.pdf>. |16  <http://unfccc.int/bodies/awg/items/8743.php>.  |17  FCCC/ADP/2014/L.5. ||5 || | | |                                                           | | | | | | |FCCC/ADP/2014/4 ||2.

At  its  2nd  meeting,  the  SBI  considered  and |adopted the conclusions below.6 ||2.  Conclusions ||12. |The  SBI  continued  its  discussion,  initiated  at  SBI  40,  on  the  revision  of  the |“Guidelines for the preparation of national communications by Parties included in Annex I |to  the  Convention,  Part  II:  UNFCCC  reporting  guidelines  on  national  communications” |(hereinafter referred to as the UNFCCC reporting guidelines on NCs).7 ||13. |The  SBI  made  progress  on  the  scope  of  the  revision  of  the  UNFCCC  reporting |guidelines  on  NCs,  including  the  alignment  of  the  tables  in  the  guidelines  with  the |information provided in biennial reporting common tabular format tables 5, 6(a), 6(b), 6(c), |7,  7(a),  7(b)  and  9.  It  advanced  its  discussion  of  the  revisions  to  the  projection  timeline |specified  in  paragraph  37  of  the  UNFCCC  reporting  guidelines  on  NCs,  and  noted  the |placeholders for future consideration of reporting elements, including the reporting on any |economic and social consequences of response measures.  ||14. |The  SBI  invited  Parties  to  submit  further  views  on  the  revision  of  the  UNFCCC |reporting  guidelines  on  NCs,  taking  into  account  the  need  to  ensure  consistency,  to  the |extent  possible,  between  the  reporting  requirements  for  biennial  reports  and  national |communications, by 1 September 2015.  ||15. |The  SBI  requested  the  secretariat  to  revise  and  update  the  technical  paper  on  the |revision  of  the  UNFCCC  reporting  guidelines  on  NCs8  in  order  to  reflect  the  views |submitted  by  Parties.9  It  also  requested  that  the  tables  and  the  revised  projection  timeline ||5  FCCC/SBI/2015/L.9.  |6  Draft conclusions presented in document FCCC/SBI/2015/L.10.  |7  Contained in document FCCC/CP/1999/7. |8  FCCC/TP/2014/5. |9  The views submitted by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention include those submitted on |their experiences with preparing their first biennial reports in response to the invitation of the ||8 || | | | |                                                           | | | | | | |FCCC/SBI/2015/10 ||referenced in paragraph 13 above be included in the revised and updated technical paper so |as to inform further discussion at SBI 43 (November–December 2015). ||16. |In view of the progress made at this session, the SBI agreed to continue its work on |the  revision  of  the  UNFCCC  reporting  guidelines  on  NCs  at  SBI  43  with  a  view  to  the |revised guidelines being adopted by the Conference of the Parties (COP) at its twenty-first |session (November–December 2015).  ||The SBI recognized that if additional time beyond SBI 43 is required, owing to the |17. |technical nature of the UNFCCC reporting guidelines on NCs, Parties should aim to adopt |the  revised  guidelines  by  COP  22  (November  2016).  In  this  case,  the  SBI  requests  the |secretariat, under the guidance of the Chair of the SBI, to organize a pre-session workshop |prior  to  SBI 44  in  order  to  advance  the  revision  of  the  UNFCCC  reporting  guidelines  on |NCs  in  2016,  and  to  prepare  the  workshop  report,  which  will  serve  as  input  to  the |discussion on this matter at SBI 44.  ||18. |The  SBI  took  note  of  the  estimated  budgetary  implications  of  the  activities  to  be |undertaken by the secretariat referred to in paragraph 17 above.

Proceedings ||The SBI considered this agenda sub-item at its 1st and 2nd meetings and had before it |20. |document  FCCC/SBI/2015/INF.7.10  At  its  1st  meeting,  the  SBI  agreed  to  consider  this |agenda  sub-item  in  informal  consultations  co-facilitated  by  Ms.  Plume  and  Ms.  Ann  Gan |(Singapore). At its 2nd meeting, the SBI considered and adopted the conclusions below.11 ||2.  Conclusions ||21. |The  SBI  welcomed  the  information  provided  by  the  secretariat  of  the  Global |Environment  Facility  (GEF)  on  the  financial  support  provided  by  the  GEF  for  the |preparation  of  biennial  update  reports  (BURs)  by  Parties  not  included  in  Annex  I  to  the |Convention (non-Annex I Parties).12  ||22. |The  SBI  invited  the  GEF  to  continue  providing  detailed,  accurate,  timely  and |complete  information  on  its  activities  relating  to  the  preparation  of  BURs,  including |information on the dates of requests for funding, approval and disbursement of funds,  and |an approximate date of submission of BURs to the secretariat, for consideration at SBI 43. ||23. |The  SBI  noted  with  appreciation  that  10  non-Annex  I  Parties  had  submitted  their |first BURs by December 2014 and welcomed the three additional BURs submitted between |1 January and 8 June 2015. A further 18 non-Annex I Parties are expected to submit their |first BURs by 31 December 2015.  ||24. |The  SBI  noted  that,  as  at  9  June  2015,  there  were  many  outstanding  BURs,  while |recognizing  the  challenges  that  non-Annex  I  Parties  face  in  submitting  their  BURs  in  a |timely manner. It recalled decision 2/CP.17, paragraph 41(a), which states that non-Annex I |Parties,  consistent  with  their  capabilities  and  the  level  of  support  provided  for  reporting, |should  submit  their  first  BURs  by  December  2014.  The  SBI  encouraged  non-Annex  I |Parties that  have not  submitted their first BURs to complete  and submit them  in a timely |manner. ||25. |The  SBI  also  noted  that,  as  at  29  May  2015,  the  GEF  secretariat  had  received  51 |requests for funds from non-Annex I Parties for the preparation of their BURs, and that an |umbrella  programme  for  BURs  implemented  by  the  United  Nations  Environment |Programme (UNEP) seeks to support 39 additional non-Annex I Parties in preparing their |first BURs.  ||26. |The SBI recalled decision 2/CP.17, paragraph 41(d), through which the COP urged |non-Annex I Parties that have not submitted their requests to the GEF for financial support |for the preparation of their first BURs to do so in a timely manner. It also encouraged GEF |agencies  to  continue  to  facilitate  the  preparation  and  submission  of  project  proposals  by |non-Annex I Parties for the preparation of their BURs. ||27. |The  SBI  noted  with  appreciation  the  operationalization  by  the  GEF  of  its  Global |Support  Programme  (GSP).13  It  continued  to  encourage  non-Annex  I  Parties  to  take |advantage of the opportunities for technical assistance and support available under the GSP |regarding  the  preparation  of  their  national  communications  and  BURs,  including  the |requests referred to in paragraph 29 below. ||10  An update provided by a representative of the Global Environment Facility on this agenda sub-item is ||available at <www.unfccc.int/8854>.  ||11  Draft conclusions presented in document FCCC/SBI/2015/L.8.  |12  FCCC/SBI/2015/INF.7. |13  A project administered jointly by the United Nations Development Programme and UNEP with the ||objective of enhancing the support provided to non-Annex I Parties for the timely preparation of their |national communications and BURs. ||10 || | |                                                           | | | | |FCCC/SBI/2015/10 ||28. |The SBI recognized the contribution made by the Consultative Group of Experts on |National  Communications  from  Parties  not  included  in  Annex  I  to  the  Convention  in |providing  technical  support  to  non-Annex  I  Parties  through  the  development  of  updated |training materials and e-learning programmes.  ||29. |The  SBI noted the requests  from non-Annex I Parties for further technical  support |aimed  at  improving  their  domestic  capacity  to  facilitate  continuity  in  meeting  reporting |requirements  through  training  on  the  use  of  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate |Change (IPCC) 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, building |sustainable national greenhouse gas inventory management systems, and understanding and |applying best practices relevant to the  setting  up of domestic  measurement,  reporting and |verification  systems.  It  encouraged  the  secretariat,  in  coordination  with  UNEP  and  the |United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), to make every effort to ensure that the |relevant training is made available to all non-Annex I Parties.  ||30. |The  SBI  took  note  of  the  estimated  budgetary  implications  of  the  activities  to  be |undertaken by the secretariat referred to in paragraph 29 above. It requested that the actions |of the secretariat called for in these conclusions be undertaken subject to the availability of |financial resources. ||V.

At its 2nd meeting, |the SBI considered and adopted the conclusions below.74 ||2.  Conclusions ||137.  The  SBI  considered  the  proposed  programme  budget  for  the  biennium  2016–2017 |and the budget for the ITL for the biennium 2016–2017.75 ||It recommended that COP 21 approve a core programme budget of EUR 54,648,484 ||138. |for the biennium 2016–2017. ||139.  The SBI recommended that the COP authorize the Executive Secretary to implement |decisions  that  may  be  taken  at  COP  21  for  which  provisions  are  not  made  under  the |approved  budget  by  using  voluntary  contributions  and,  to  the  extent  possible,  resources |available under the core budget. ||140.  The  SBI  authorized  the  Executive  Secretary  to  notify  Parties  of  their  2016 |contributions, based on the budget amount shown in paragraph 138 above, after taking into |account the special annual contribution from the Host Government of EUR 766,938. ||72  FCCC/SBI/2015/INF.8. |73  Available at <www.unfccc.int/8854>.  |74  Draft conclusions presented in document FCCC/SBI/2015/L.18.  |75  FCCC/SBI/2015/3 and Add.1–3. ||25 || | | | | |                                                           | | | | |FCCC/SBI/2015/10 ||141.  The SBI also authorized the Executive Secretary to notify the Parties concerned of |their annual fee for 2016 for the connection of their national registry to, and use of, the ITL |and for the related activities of the ITL administrator. ||142.

The  SBI  noted  the  information  in  the  reports  by  the  representative  of  the  Host |Government  and  the  Executive  Secretary  that  the  design  of  an  extension  building  on  the |United Nations Campus, which is to enable the entire secretariat to be located  at the same |premises,  is  making  good  progress,  with  works  starting  in  January  2016  and  completion |scheduled within three years. ||150.  The  SBI welcomed the continued collaboration between the Host Government,  the |secretariat and other relevant stakeholders on issues such as meeting and office facilities as |well as enhanced services and information for meeting participants. It encouraged the Host |Government and the secretariat to maintain this process of close and regular consultations. ||151.  The  SBI  requested  the  secretariat  to  continue  to  update  Parties  on  the  UNFCCC |website  about  these  and  other  aspects  of  the  implementation  of  the  Headquarters |Agreement  and  invited  the  Host  Government  and  the  Executive  Secretary  to  report  to |SBI 46 (May 2017) on progress made. ||  XVI.  Other matters ||(Agenda item 16) ||Proceedings ||152.  The  SBI  considered  this  item  at  its  resumed  1st  meeting  and  2nd  meeting. |Representatives of two Parties made statements. At the resumed 1st meeting, the issue of the |finalization of the nominations for membership of the Executive Committee of the Warsaw |International  Mechanism  for  Loss  and  Damage  associated  with  Climate  Change  Impacts |was  raised,  as  well  as  the  issue  of  the  consideration  of  the  3rd  review  of  the  Adaptation |Fund. At the same meeting, the Chair proposed undertaking general consultations on those |issues and reporting back on the outcome thereof to the SBI at its closing meeting. ||153.  At  the  2nd  meeting,  the  Chair  reported  on  the  outcome  of  his  consultations,  as |detailed in paragraphs 154-157 below. ||154.  The issue of the finalization of the nominations to the Executive Committee of the |Warsaw International Mechanism was raised at the Bureau meeting of 3 June. The Bureau |appointed  the  COP  Vice-President,  Mr.  Cheik  Sylla  (Senegal),  to  consult  on  this  issue  as |part of the overall consultations on nominations for elections that he had been designated to |conduct by the COP President. ||155.  During  his  consultations  on  elections  with  the  Chairs  of  all  regional  groups  and |constituencies held on 9 June, Mr. Sylla requested all groups to urgently finalize and submit |the pending nominations by the closing of the sessions in Bonn.  ||156.  The SBI Chair confirmed that all  nominations  for  non-Annex I  Parties  and Parties |included in Annex I to the Convention have now been submitted and thanked all Parties for ||27 || |FCCC/SBI/2015/10 ||their nominations, as well as Mr. Sylla for his efforts in securing them.80 Arrangements for |convening the first meeting of the Executive Committee can now be made. ||157.  The Chair informed the SBI that, in accordance with decision 2/CMP.10, the SBI is |requested  to  initiate  the  3rd  review  of  the  Adaptation  Fund  at  SBI  44  and  report  back  to |CMP 12 on the outcomes of its deliberations. ||  XVII.  Closure of and report on the session ||(Agenda item 17) ||1.  Administrative and budgetary implications ||158.  At  the  2nd  meeting,  a  representative  of  the  secretariat  provided  a  preliminary |evaluation  of  the  administrative  and  budgetary  implications  of  the  conclusions  adopted |during the session in accordance with rule 15 of the draft rules of procedure being applied. ||159.  The  secretariat  informed  Parties  that  a  number  of  activities  had  arisen  from  the |negotiations at the session that call for the provision of more support by the secretariat and, |therefore,  require  additional  resources  over  and  above  the  core  budget  for  2015  and  the |proposed budget for 2016–2017, as detailed below. ||160.  Under  agenda  sub-item  3(c),  the  secretariat  has  been  requested  to  organize  a  pre-|session workshop prior to SBI 44 and to revise and update a technical paper on the revision |of the UNFCCC reporting guidelines on NCs. The estimated cost amounts to EUR 58,000. ||161.  Under agenda sub-item 4(b), the secretariat has been requested to make every effort |to provide training on the use of the  2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas |Inventories  to all non-Annex  I Parties. The estimated cost  amounts  to EUR 1,359,000, of |which EUR 160,000 will be needed in 2015. ||162.  Under agenda sub-items 9(a) and (b), the secretariat has been requested to organize a |workshop back-to-back with an ADP session to discuss how to enhance capacity-building, |with  a  report  thereon  to  be  prepared  for  consideration  at  SBI  43.  The  estimated  cost |amounts to EUR 47,000.  ||163.  The  SBI  has  given  the  secretariat  further  mandates  in  addition  to  those  referred  to |above.  However,  the  corresponding  resource  requirements  will  be  absorbed  by  available |resources. The above-stated amounts are  preliminary and based on the  currently  available |information. Overall, additional funds amounting to EUR 1,464,000 will be needed to cover |activities in the current year and the 2016–2017 biennium.  ||164. |In addition to the administrative and budgetary implications of the requests made by |the SBI at the session, the secretariat noted the implications of the outcome of the session |for the biennial programme budget recommended by the SBI for adoption by the COP and |the  CMP.  Parties  could  not  agree  to  cover  the  increased  resource  requirements  that  the |Executive Secretary had proposed for inclusion in the core budget and the secretariat urged |Parties  in  a  position  to  do  so  to  provide  supplementary  funding  to  meet  the  additional |requirements  for:  additional  meetings  of  the  constituted  bodies,  as  the  core budget  can  in |the biennium 2016–2017 accommodate only two meetings of each body rather than three; |reviews of greenhouse gas inventories, to cover in-country reviews and reviews of a higher |number of BURs; strengthening the Adaptation programme in the area of loss and damage, |the  Adaptation Committee and  the NAP process; organizing side events and exhibits; and ||80  See <http://unfccc.int/adaptation/cancun_adaptation_framework/loss_and_damage/items/8806.php>.  ||28 || |                                                           | |FCCC/SBI/2015/10 ||institutional strengthening, in particular information technology (IT) security and other key |IT and communication functions. ||2.

It also established a new process |under the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) – international assessment and review |(IAR)  –  that  aims  to  promote  the  comparability  of  efforts  among  all  developed  country |Parties. The first round of the IAR process is to be conducted during the period 2014–2015. ||2. |According to the modalities and procedures for IAR specified in annex II to decision |2/CP.17,  the  multilateral  assessment  (MA),  being  part  of  the  IAR  process,  is  to  be |conducted for each developed country Party at a working group session of the SBI, with the |participation  of  all  Parties.  The  aim  of  the  MA  is  to  assess  each  Party’s  progress  in |implementation towards the achievement of emission reductions and removals related to its |quantified economy-wide emission reduction target. ||3. |The  second  MA  working  group  session  was  convened  during  SBI  42  under  the |chairmanship  of  Mr.  Amena  Yauvoli  (Fiji),  the  SBI  Chair,  and  was  preceded  by  a  three-|month period of questions and answers; in the first  month, any Party  may  submit  written |questions  to  the  Party  being  assessed,  which  may  respond  to  the  questions  within  the |remaining two months. A summary report for each of the  24 Parties that were assessed at |SBI 42 is presented below. The reports are also available on the UNFCCC website  on the |individual Party pages.1  ||4. |In  closing  the  MA  for  each  Party,  the  SBI  Chair  reminded  the  Party  that  it  can |submit any other observations on its MA process within two months of the working group |session, and that they will form part of its Party record for the MA. The SBI Chair thanked |all Parties and the secretariat for the successful MA working group session. ||1  See <www.unfccc.int/8451>. ||30 ||                                                           | |FCCC/SBI/2015/10 ||Summary report on multilateral assessment of Australia ||The first MA of Australia took place on 4 June 2015. Australia was represented by ||1. |Mr. Peter Woolcott, Ambassador for the Environment. ||2. |Questions  for  Australia  had  been  submitted  in  writing  two  months  before  the |working  group  session  by  Brazil,  China,  the  European  Union  (EU),  New  Zealand,  Saudi |Arabia, Switzerland and the United States of America. A list of the questions received and |the answers provided by Australia can be found on the IAR web page for Australia.1  ||3. |Mr.  Woolcott  made  an  opening  presentation,  summarizing  Australia’s  progress  in |implementation towards the achievement of emission reductions and removals related to its |quantified  economy-wide  emission  reduction  targets.  He  also  provided  an  update  on |Australia’s  recent  policy  changes  concerning  emission  reductions.  According  to  Mr. |Woolcott,  Australia  is  on  track  to  meet  its  2020  target,  which  is  5  per  cent  below  2000 |emission  levels  by  2020.  Based  on  its  2015  national  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  inventory |report,  Australia  overachieved  its  target  for  the  first  commitment  period  of  the  Kyoto |Protocol  by  129  million  tonnes  (Mt)  of  carbon  dioxide  equivalent  (CO2  eq).  In  addition, |Australia  has  advanced  towards  its  2020  target  through  policy  interventions,  such  as  the |improvement  in  energy  efficiency  and  the  facilitation  of  changes  of  the  economy.  A |comparison  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  and  population  growth  with  emission |intensity of GDP and emissions per capita shows that Australia has decoupled its emissions |from GDP and population growth. ||In his presentation, Mr. Woolcott elaborated on the implementation of the Emissions |4. |Reduction Fund (ERF), the central piece of the 2014 Direct Action Plan, which replaced the |former  carbon  tax.  The  ERF  is  the  main  mechanism  for  achieving  the  2020  target  and  it |aims to tackle economy-wide mitigation potential. The first auction under the ERF was held |in  April  2015,  with  over  47  Mt  CO2  eq  abatement  contracted.  A  safeguard  mechanism  is |planned to be put in place to ensure that emission reductions purchased by the Government |under  the  ERF  are  not  offset  by  significant  rises  in  emissions  elsewhere  in  the  economy. |Apart from the ERF, policies and measures (PaMs) in place to meet Australia’s 2020 target |include  the  amended  Renewable  Energy  Target,  energy  efficiency  measures  and  the |National Energy Productivity Plan.  ||5. |The opening presentation was followed by interventions and questions from  Brazil, |China,  Fiji,  Japan,  New  Zealand,  the  Republic  of  Korea,  Saudi  Arabia,  Switzerland,  the |United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (United Kingdom), and the United |States. These questions were on: the mitigation potential of the ERF; lessons learned from |the  first  auction  under  the  ERF  and  companies’  reaction  to  the  ERF;  the  mechanism  to |monitor the effectiveness of the ERF; the rigour of the safeguard mechanism and key issues |raised  during  the  public  consultation  stage  of  the  mechanism;  the  conditionality  and |ambition  of  Australia’s  2020  target;  the  role  of  updated  GHG  emission  projections  in |policymaking;  difficulties  in  estimating  policy  effects  by  gas;  the  Renewable  Energy |Target;  and  the  vehicle  emission  standard  as  part  of  the  policy  package  towards  2020. |Questions were also raised in relation to Australia’s assessment of the social and economic |consequences  of  response  measures.

Belgium  was  represented  by |1. |Mr. Peter Wittoeck, Head of Climate Change Section, Federal Directorate-General for the |Environment. ||Questions  for  Belgium  had  been  submitted  in  writing  two  months  before  the |2. |working group session by Brazil, Canada, China, New Zealand and the United States. A list |of the  questions received and the answers provided by Belgium can be found on the IAR |web page for Belgium.1  ||Mr.  Wittoeck  made  an  opening  presentation,  summarizing  Belgium’s  progress |3. |towards  the  achievement  of  its  quantified  economy-wide  emission  reduction  targets. |Emissions,  excluding  those  from  the  land  use,  land-use  change  and  forestry  (LULUCF) |sector,  decreased  by  18.5  per  cent  between  1990  and  2012  despite  growth  in  GDP  and |population over the same period. The emission intensity of the economy has thus decreased |over  this  period,  indicating  a  certain  decoupling  of  emissions  from  economic  growth. |According  to  Mr.  Wittoeck,  Belgium  is  expected  to  achieve  its  target  for  the  first |commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol.  ||Mr.  Wittoeck  presented  Belgium’s  target  for  2020  for  sectors  outside  the  EU |4. |Emissions  Trading  System  (EU  ETS)  as  well  as  the  common  EU  target  for  EU  ETS  as |contained in the EU 2020 climate and energy package. Belgium has put in place a range of |policies  and  measures  in  order  to  achieve  its  2020  target,  including  for  the  renewable |energy,  building  and  transport  sectors.  Its  National  Climate  Policy  is  formulated  using  a |bottom-up approach – it is based on regional and federal climate policies.  ||5. |The opening presentation was followed by interventions and questions from Algeria, |Brazil, China, India and the United States. The questions were on: shares of transport and |commercial  sectors  in  Belgium’s  GHG  emissions;  the  inclusion  of  emissions  from |international  aviation  in  the  2020  targets;  the  key  policies  and  measures  for  the  energy |sector,  in  particular  as  related  to  the  transport  and  commercial  sectors;  policies  and |measures  for  the  agriculture  and  waste  sectors,  including  those  planned  to  increase |mitigation in the agriculture sector; and the quantification of impacts of mitigation policies |and measures with the greatest contribution  to the achievement of Belgium’s 2020 targets |and  their  main  focus  in  the  future.  Clarification  was  also  requested  on  how  Belgian |domestic energy policy fits into the EU energy policy, division of mitigation effort between |federal and regional levels, and how the Belgian National Climate Policy takes into account |federal  and  regional  policies.  Belgium  was  furthermore  asked  to  clarify  how  it  plans  to |create incentives for other EU member States to undertake greater mitigation efforts in view |of  the  downward  trend  in  its  own  emissions  since  2005.

Bulgaria  was  represented  by ||1. |Ms. Veneta Borikova from the Ministry of Environment and Water. ||2. |Questions  for  Bulgaria  had  been  submitted  in  writing  two  months  before  the |working  group  session  by  Brazil  and  China.  A  list  of  the  questions  received  and  the |answers provided by Bulgaria can be found on the IAR web page for Bulgaria.1  ||3. |Ms.  Borikova  made  an  opening  presentation,  summarizing  Bulgaria’s  progress |towards  the  achievement  of  its  quantified  economy-wide  emission  reduction  targets. |Emissions,  excluding  those  from  the  LULUCF  sector,  decreased  by  nearly  41  per  cent |between 1988 and 2012  mainly owing to structural changes stemming from the  transition |from a centrally-planned economy to a market economy.  ||4. |Ms. Borikova presented Bulgaria’s individual targets for 2020 for sectors outside the |EU ETS and renewable energy set under the EU climate and energy package. Bulgaria has |put in place a range of policies and measures in order to achieve its 2020 targets as part of |its Third National Action Plan on Climate Change, including for the energy, household and |services,  waste  and  transport  sectors.  According  to  preliminary  estimates,  Bulgaria  is |expected to over-achieve its 2013 targets for sectors not covered by the EU ETS (non-ETS |sectors), as well as its targets for renewable energy and biofuels under the EU climate and |energy package. ||The opening presentation  was followed by interventions and questions  from  China |5. |and the Marshall Islands. Bulgaria was requested to clarify whether it would consider the |possibility of raising its target under the EU climate and energy package in order to allow |the EU to raise its target for 2020 in view of the significant projected reductions in national |emissions  compared  with  the  1990  levels.  Information  was  also  sought  regarding  the |relationship of Bulgaria’s Climate Change Mitigation Act  with its Energy Act, Renewable |Energy  Act,  Energy  Efficiency  Act  and  National  Climate  Action  Plan.  Another  question |related to the time frame of Bulgaria’s plans for increased use of cleaner energy sources in |place  of  coal  for  power  generation  in  relation  to  the  time  frame  for  its  planned  move |towards a more electrified public transport system.  In response, Bulgaria provided further |explanations.

Canada  was  represented  by ||1. |Ms. Louise Métivier, Environment Canada. ||2. |Questions for Canada had been submitted in writing two months before the working |group session by Brazil, China, the EU, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, Switzerland |and  the  United  States.  Canada  submitted  written  answers  after  the  deadline.  A  list  of  the |questions received and the answers provided by Canada can be found on the IAR web page |for Canada.1  ||Ms.  Métivier  made  an  opening  presentation,  summarizing  Canada’s  national |3. |circumstances, the impacts of climate change felt in Canada, the institutional arrangements |it  has  made  with  regard  to  its  climate  change  policy,  and  its  GHG  emission  trends  and |projections. She also summarized the steps  Canada  has taken towards the achievement of |its  quantified  economy-wide  emission  reduction  target.  According  to  Ms.  Métivier,  the |implementation of current PaMs will contribute a reduction of 130 Mt of CO2 eq towards |Canada’s  2020  target,  which  is  17 per  cent  below  2005  emission  levels  by  2020,  and  the |Party  will  require  an  additional  reduction  of  116  Mt  CO2  eq  to  reach  the  target.  A |comparison  of  GHG  emission  growth  with  the  emission  intensity  of  GDP  shows  that |Canada has achieved some level of decoupling of its emissions from GDP growth. ||4. |Ms. Métivier emphasized that Canada’s sector by sector regulatory approach focuses |on  the  two  most  polluting  sectors,  transportation  and  coal-fired  electricity  production. |Transportation  emits  about  25  per  cent  of  Canada’s  total  emissions;  therefore,  Canada |intends  to  develop  more  stringent  GHG  emission  standards  for  road  transportation. |Emissions  from  coal-fired  electricity  production  are  addressed  by  federal  and  provincial |measures phasing out coal-fired electricity generation over the long term. In addition, Ms. |Métivier noted that Canada puts great effort into research, development and demonstration |for CO2 storage and sequestration and that the mitigation efforts of provinces and territories |are making a significant contribution to meeting the national target. ||5. |The  opening  presentation  was  followed  by  interventions  and  questions  from |Australia, Brazil, China, the EU, Japan, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Sweden |and the United States. These questions were on: the use of units from LULUCF and the use |of  international  market-based  mechanisms  to  achieve  the  target;  ways  to  deliver  the |required  116  Mt  CO2  eq  reductions  to  achieve  the  2020  target;  the  effects  of  current  and |additional  PaMs;  uncertainties  in  the  estimation  of  emissions/removals  in  the  LULUCF |sector; new regulations in the electricity and transportation sectors; regulations addressing |fluorinated gases; mapping the differences in the classification of economic sections versus |the sectoral classification used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; scale of |investments  in  clean  technologies;  and  the  roles  of  provinces  and  territories  in  the |implementation of the climate change policy. Questions were also raised in relation to the |Party’s  assessment  of  the  social  and  economic  consequences  of  response  measures.  In |response, Canada provided further explanations.

The Czech Republic ||1. |was represented by Mr. Pavel Zamyslicky from the Ministry of the Environment. ||2. |Questions for Czech Republic had been submitted in writing two months before the |working  group session by  Brazil, Canada and  China.  A list of the  questions received and |the  answers  provided  by  the  Czech  Republic  can  be  found  on  the  IAR  web  page  for  the |Czech Republic.1  ||3. |Mr. Zamyslicky  made an opening presentation, summarizing  the Czech  Republic’s |progress in the implementation of its emission reduction and removal commitments related |to  its  quantified  economy-wide  emission  reduction  targets.  Under  the  Convention,  the |Czech  Republic  participates  in  the  EU  joint  economy-wide  emission  reduction  target  to |achieve a 20 per cent reduction in emissions by 2020 compared with the 1990 (base year) |level.  The  target  for  the  EU  and  its  member  States  is  formalized  in  the  EU  climate  and |energy package, which includes the EU ETS and the effort-sharing decision (ESD). Under |the ESD, the Czech Republic has a target to limit emission growth to 9 per cent above the |2005  level  by  2020  (+9  per  cent)  from  sectors  covered  by  the  ESD.  In  line  with  the  EU |approach to its target, the Czech Republic does not include emissions or removals from the |LULUCF  sector  in  defining  its  quantified  economy-wide  target.  The  ESD  also  includes |binding renewable energy goals and non-binding energy efficiency goals for each member |State.  The  Czech  Republic  has  a  binding  renewable  energy  goal  to  achieve  a  13  per  cent |share  of  renewable  energy  in  its  gross  total  final  energy  consumption.  Its  non-binding |energy efficiency goal is to achieve additional energy savings of 13.27 TWh by 2020.  ||4. |The Czech Republic’s total GHG emissions excluding emissions and removals from |LULUCF decreased by 31.5 per cent between 1990 and 2011, with projections showing a |continuous decrease in emissions up to 2020. In order to meet its 2020 targets,  the Czech |Republic  is  currently  drafting  the  Climate  Protection  Policy,  which  will  include  the |implementation  of  the  EU  climate  and  energy  package,  as  well  as  its  emission  reduction |targets  for  2020  under  the  Convention.  In  addition,  the  Czech  Republic  is  preparing  the |State Energy Policy, which includes a 30-year outlook for identifying energy management |objectives.  Across  the  EU,  it  is  expected  that  the  market  mechanism  of  the  EU  ETS  will |guarantee that emissions from sectors under this scheme will achieve the 2020 target of 21 |per cent below the 2005 level. Under the ESD, the Czech Republic is expected to meet its |emission reduction target as well as its renewable energy and energy efficiency goals.  ||5. |The opening presentation was followed by interventions and questions from  Brazil, |China  and  the  United  States.  The  questions  received  focused  on:  whether  the  Czech |Republic is considering increasing its emission reduction target for 2020 since the current |target has already been met; what, if any, market-based mechanisms will be used to achieve |its targets; whether the Czech Republic is considering adopting additional PaMs to address |its  emissions  not  covered  by  the  EU  ETS;  what  PaMs  addressing  the  implementation  of |new nuclear energy and other renewable energy sources (RES) are in place, and whether or |not  there  are  interim  targets  prior  to  2020  for  the  implementation  of  such  sources.  In |response,  the  Czech  Republic  provided  further  explanations.  Details  can  be  found  in  the |webcast of this session on the IAR web page for Czech Republic. ||1  <http://unfccc.int/8818.php>. ||35 || |                                                           | |FCCC/SBI/2015/10 ||Summary report on multilateral assessment of Estonia ||The  first  MA  of  Estonia  took  place  on  4 June  2015.  Estonia  was  represented  by ||1. |Mr. Meelis Münt from the Ministry of the Environment. ||2. |Questions for Estonia had been submitted in writing two months before the working |group  session  by  Brazil  and  China.  A  list  of  the  questions  received  and  the  answers |provided by Estonia can be found on the IAR web page for Estonia.1  ||3. |Mr.  Münt  made  an  opening  presentation,  summarizing  Estonia’s  progress  in  the |implementation of its emission reduction and removal commitments related to its quantified |economy-wide emission reduction targets. He elaborated on the  national circumstances of |Estonia  as  a  small  economy  and  member  State  of  the  EU.  Estonia  is  committed  to |contribute to the emission reduction target of the EU under the Convention and its Kyoto |Protocol. Under the ESD, Estonia has a target of limiting the growth of its emissions in the |non-ETS sectors to 11 per cent by 2020 compared with the 2005 level (+11 per cent). He |explained  that  the  target  of  the  first  commitment  period  of  the  Kyoto  Protocol  had  been |overachieved, with an emission reduction of 52.8 per cent in 2012 compared with the 1990 |level. This  was partly due to  a decoupling of economic growth and  GHG emissions from |1990  to  2012,  when  GDP,  after  an  initial  decline  in  the  1990s,  almost  doubled,  while |emissions  halved.  Although  emissions  decreased  in  all  sectors,  the  most  significant |reductions  could  be  observed  in  the  energy  and  agriculture  sectors.  However,  in  2012, |energy  remained  the  most  significant  sector  in  terms  of  GHG  emissions,  with  a  share  of |87.9 per cent of the total. ||4. |Successful  implementation  of  national  PaMs  has  led  to  a  transformation  of  the |energy  supply  structure  towards  an  increase  in  the  share  of  renewables  to  25  per  cent  in |gross  final  energy  consumption  in  2014;  limitations  on  oil  shale  extraction  to  20  million |t/year;  an  efficiency  improvement  in  the  use  of  oil  shale;  investments  in  climate  change |mitigation  and  energy  efficiency  measures  of  more  than  EUR  700  million;  and |environmental  taxation  reaching  2.8  per  cent  of  GDP.  In  addition,  several  strategies  and |plans are under preparation to achieve the Party’s long-term targets, including the Estonian |Low Carbon Road Map up to 2050, the Estonian National Development Plan of the Energy |Sector up to 2030, the National Development Plan for the Use of Oil Shale 2016–2020 and |the national Climate Change Adaptation Strategy up to 2030. Thus, Estonia projects further |significant emission reductions and expects to fulfil its commitments for 2020.  ||The opening presentation  was followed by interventions and questions  from  China |5. |and the Republic of Korea. The questions were on emission levels and trends in the energy |and LULUCF sectors, and the specific measures to reduce GHG emissions in the industrial |processes  and  agriculture  sectors.  In  response,  Estonia  provided  further  explanations. |Details can be found in the webcast of this session on the IAR web page for Estonia. ||1  <http://unfccc.int/8819.php>. ||36 ||                                                           | |FCCC/SBI/2015/10 ||Summary report on multilateral assessment of Germany ||The first MA of Germany took place on 4 June 2015. Germany was represented by |1. |Mr.  Martin  Weiß  from  the  Ministry  for  the  Environment,  Nature  Conservation,  Building |and Nuclear Safety. ||2. |Questions  for  Germany  had  been  submitted  in  writing  two  months  before  the |working  group  session  by  Australia,  Brazil,  China,  New  Zealand,  Saudi  Arabia  and  the |United States. A list of the questions received and the answers provided by Germany can be |found on the IAR web page for Germany.1  ||Mr.  Weiß  made  an  opening  presentation,  summarizing  Germany’s  progress  in  the |3. |implementation of its emission reduction and removal commitments related to its quantified |economy-wide emission reduction targets. He explained that Germany, as a member State |of  the  EU,  has  a  target  under  the  ESD  to  reduce  its  emissions  in  the  non-ETS  sectors  by |14 per  cent  by  2020  compared  with  the  2005  level.  In  addition,  Germany  has  a  national |target of reducing its GHG emissions by 40 per cent by 2020 compared with the 1990 level. |He  also  described  the  targets  for  Germany’s  energy  transition  plan  for  the  period  up  to |2050,  which  aims  to  reduce  GHG  emissions,  increase  the  share  of  renewable  energy  and |improve energy efficiency.  GHG emissions are estimated to be  27 per cent lower in 2014 |compared with 1990, a reduction that was achieved despite the economic growth of 39 per |cent in the same period. All  sectors contributed to these emission reductions, with highest |absolute reductions in the energy sector and highest relative reductions in the waste sector |as a result of the banning of landfilled waste.  ||taxes, ||The  main  PaMs  that  contributed  to  the  reduction  are  the  Renewable  Energy  Act, |4. |energy |transport  efficiency  measures,  building  efficiency  measures  and |corresponding  support  programmes  and  all  EU-wide  mitigation  PaMs.  In  addition  to |emission  reductions,  the  successful  implementation  of  these  PaMs  led  to  a  significant |creation  of  jobs  in  the  areas  of  renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency  technologies. |According to the latest projections, Germany can achieve an emission reduction of 33–34 |per cent by 2020 with existing PaMs. To close the gap to its national target of a 40 per cent |reduction, the Federal Cabinet adopted the Climate  Action Programme 2020 in December |2014. The programme is also considered an important milestone towards reaching its 2050 |target  of  an  emission  reduction  of  80–95  per  cent,  as  it  outlines  the  process  for  the |elaboration of the Climate Policy Plan 2050, to be developed by 2016. The development of |the Climate Policy Plan will be underpinned by a broad dialogue and participation  process |during 2015–2016 and will focus on long-term climate targets. ||5. |The opening presentation was followed by interventions and questions from  Brazil, |China,  Fiji,  Japan,  Maldives,  New  Zealand,  the  Republic  of  Korea,  Saudi  Arabia  and  the |United States. The questions were on: clarification regarding Germany’s national target and |the target under the ESD, including their comparability and the potential effects of a more |ambitious national target on other EU member States; progress made in the optimization of |the  introduction  of  RES,  including  feed-in  tariffs  and  the  types  of  incentives  for  private |households  for  installing  solar  energy  generation  devices;  the  PaMs  to  incentivize  and |protect  investments  for  energy  transformation;  specifics  of  the  PaMs  affecting  the  waste |sector;  PaMs  affecting  shipping  emissions;  the  status  of  implementation  of  PaMs  in  the |Climate Action Programme; drivers of emission trends in recent years; the projected share |of  renewables  and  other  energy  sources  in  the  energy  mix  by  2020  and  the  Party’s |experiences  in  comparing  the  national  GHG  emission  inventory  with  external  data. ||1  <http://unfccc.int/8820.php>. ||37 || |                                                           | |FCCC/SBI/2015/10 ||Questions were also raised in relation to Germany’s assessment of the social and economic |consequences of response  measures.

Greece  was  represented  by |1. |Mr. Ioannis Ziomas, Advisor to the Minister of Environment, Energy and Climate Change. ||2. |Questions for Greece had been submitted in writing two months before the working |group session by Brazil, China and the United States. A list of the questions received and |the answers provided by Greece can be found on the IAR web page for Greece.1  ||3. |Mr.  Ziomas  made  an  opening  presentation,  summarizing  Greece’s  progress  in  the |implementation of its emission reduction and removal commitments related to its quantified |economy-wide  emission reduction targets.  Under the  Convention,  Greece is committed to |the EU joint economy-wide emission reduction target to achieve a 20 per cent reduction in |emissions by 2020 compared with the 1990 (base year) level. The target for the EU and its |member States is formalized in the 2020  EU climate and energy package, which includes |the EU ETS and the ESD. Under the ESD, Greece has an emission reduction target of 4 per |cent below the 2005 level by 2020 for the sectors covered by the ESD. In line with the EU |approach to its target, Greece does not include emissions or removals from LULUCF sector |in defining its quantified economy-wide emission reduction target. The ESD also includes |binding  renewable  energy  goals  and  non-binding  energy  efficiency  goals  for  each  EU |member  State.  Greece  has  a  binding  renewable  energy  goal  of  achieving  an  18  per  cent |share of renewable energy in its gross total final energy consumption, which it voluntarily |increased  to  20  per  cent.  Regarding  energy  efficiency,  Greece  has  a  non-binding  goal  to |limit its final energy consumption to 18.4 Mtoe by 2020.  ||4. |To meet its 2020 targets, Greece has various PaMs in place, including the PaMs for |the promotion of RES and the promotion of natural gas. The PaM for the promotion of RES |includes  Greece’s  national  renewable  energy  action  plan  and  a  feed-in  tariff  for |incentivizing  the  installation  of  renewable  energy.  Under  the  PaM  for  the  promotion  of |natural gas, Greece undertook a number of actions from 1996 to 2013, such as maintaining |no  excise  duty,  developing  natural  gas  infrastructure  and  encouraging  fuel  switching. |Greece’s emissions and removals for 2012 were estimated to be 5.8 per cent above the 1990 |level excluding LULUCF,  with the  projections showing a  slight decrease  in emissions by |2020  compared  with  the  1990  level.  Across  the  EU,  it  is  expected  that  the  market |mechanism of  the EU ETS  will guarantee  that emissions  from  the  sectors  covered by the |EU ETS will be in line with the 2020 target of 21 per cent below the 2005 level. Under the |ESD,  Greece  is  expected  to  meet  its  emission  reduction  target  as  well  as  its  renewable |energy and energy efficiency goals.  ||5. |The opening presentation was followed by interventions and questions from  Brazil, |China, India and the United States. The questions focused on: what domestic PaMs are in |place to fulfil Greece’s 2020 target for the non-ETS sectors; whether the economic situation |in  Greece  has  the  potential  to  affect  its  climate  change  actions;  whether  Greece  will |continue to  modify its  feed-in tariff rates to encourage renewable energy deployment and |use;  how  Greece  plans  to  address  the  rising  emissions  from  the  transport  sector;  and |Greece’s  use of biodiesel and  whether it  will consider the  use of bioethanol.  In response, |Greece provided further explanations.

A  list  of  the  questions  received  and  the |answers provided by Hungary can be found on the IAR web page for Hungary.1  ||3. |Mr. Lukacs made an opening presentation, addressing the questions received prior to |the  working  group  session  and  the  answers  provided.  He  described  the  historical  and |projected impacts of climate change in Hungary for the period 1901–2100. In addition, he |explained the emission trends in Hungary for the period 1990–2012. He then elaborated on |the  national  circumstances  of  Hungary,  which  experienced  a  significant  reduction  (by  36 |per cent during 1990–2012) in GHG emissions owing to the collapse of the central planning |economic system. In the period after 1992, Hungary demonstrated a significant economic |restructuring, reduction in energy intensity and decoupling of economic development from |the emission trajectory.  ||4. |Mr.  Lukacs  explained  that,  as  a  EU  member  State,  since  2004  Hungary  has  been |committed to achieving a joint unconditional quantified economy-wide emission reduction |target  of  20  per  cent  below  the  1990  level  by  2020.  This  target  is  formalized  in  the  EU |climate  and  energy  package,  which  includes  the  EU  ETS  and  the  ESD.  Under  the  ESD, |Hungary has committed to a target of limiting its emissions growth to 10 per cent compared |with  the  2005  level  by  2020.  In  2012,  emissions  from  sectors  covered  by  the  ESD  were |already 18 per cent below the 2005 level. Hungary appears to be on track to meet its target |and is likely to overachieve it.  ||5. |Regarding  the  progress  made  towards  achieving  the  2020  targets,  it  was |acknowledged  that  a  number  of  PaMs  have  been  put  in  place  by  Hungary  to  address  its |joint  EU  commitments  under  the  Convention  and  its  Kyoto  Protocol.  Hungary’s  major |PaMs  include  its  National  Climate  Change  Strategies,  the  Decarbonisation  Roadmap,  the |Green Investment Scheme and the measures to promote the use of  RES, energy efficiency |improvements and an increase in the use of biofuels.  ||6. |The opening presentation was followed by questions from Algeria and China on the |following: the projected GHG emissions by 2020; PaMs included in the emission projection |scenario  for  the  period  ending  in  2020;  and  institutional  arrangements  and  financial |provisions  made  for  the  implementation  of  those  PaMs.  In  response,  Hungary  provided |further  explanations.  Details  can  be  found  in  the  webcast  of  this  session  on  the  IAR  web |page for Hungary. ||1 ||<http://unfccc.int/8822.php>. ||40 ||                                                           | |FCCC/SBI/2015/10 ||Summary report on multilateral assessment of Iceland ||The  first  MA  of  Iceland  took  place  on  4 June  2015.  Iceland  was  represented  by |1. |Mr. Hugi  Ólafsson,  Department  of  Oceans,  Water  and  Climate,  Ministry  for  the |Environment and Natural Resources. ||2. |Questions for Iceland had been submitted in writing two months before the working |group session by Brazil, Canada, China, the EU, New Zealand and the United States. A list |of  the  questions  received  and  the  answers  provided  by  Iceland  can  be  found  on  the  IAR |web page for Iceland.1  ||Mr. Ólafsson made an opening presentation, summarizing Iceland’s progress in the |3. |implementation of its emission reduction and removal commitments related to its quantified |economy-wide emission reduction targets. Mr. Ólafsson highlighted Iceland’s unique GHG |emission profile, where emissions from industrial processes are the major contributor to the |total national GHG emissions without emissions from LULUCF. The total GHG emissions |increased by 26 per cent from 1990 to 2012. ||4. |Mr. Ólafsson noted that Iceland, jointly with the EU, participates in efforts to reach |the  economy-wide  emission  reduction  target  for  the  second  commitment  period  of  the |Kyoto  Protocol  of  reducing  GHG  emissions  by  20  per  cent  by  2020  compared  with  the |2005 level. Iceland intends to contribute to the achievement of this target by participating in |the EU ETS and by implementing mitigation actions in the non-ETS sectors. The mitigation |action  plan  that  Iceland  has  put  in  place  aims  to  reduce  national  GHG  emissions,  and  in |particular  GHG  emissions  from  non-ETS  sectors,  by  20  per  cent  by  2020  compared  with |the  2005  level.  Iceland  has  identified  significant  mitigation  potential  in  afforestation  and |revegetation as well as in the transport and fisheries sectors.  ||5. |The opening presentation  was followed by interventions and questions  from  China |and India. These questions were on the  PaMs targeted at the reduction of GHG emissions |from  heavy  industry  and  research  on  hydrogen  vehicles.  In  response,  Iceland  provided |further  explanations.  Details  can  be  found  in  the  webcast  of  this  session  on  the  IAR  web |page for Iceland. ||1  <http://unfccc.int/8823.php>. ||41 || |                                                           | |FCCC/SBI/2015/10 ||Summary report on multilateral assessment of Ireland ||1. |The  first  MA  of  Ireland  took  place  on  4 June  2015.  Ireland  was  represented  by |Ms. Petra  Woods,  Assistant  Principal  Officer,  Climate  Policy  Section,  Department  of  the |Environment, Community and Local Government. ||2. |Questions for Ireland had been submitted in writing two months before the working |group session by Brazil, China and New Zealand. A list of the questions received and the |answers provided by Ireland can be found on the IAR web page for Ireland.1 ||3. |Ms.  Woods  made  an  opening  presentation,  summarizing  Ireland’s  progress  in |implementation towards the achievement of emission reductions and removals related to its |quantified economy-wide emission reduction targets.  ||4. |Ms. Woods presented Ireland’s target under the Convention as a contribution to the |quantified  economy-wide  emission  reduction  target  of  the  EU  and  its  member  States  to |reduce  GHG  emissions  by  20  per  cent  by  2020  compared  with  the  1990  level.  In  this |context, some 27 per cent of Ireland’s GHG emissions are covered and regulated by the EU |ETS, with no specific target for Ireland but with an overall and decreasing cap set at the EU |level to achieve an absolute emission reduction in the covered sectors of 21 per cent relative |to  the  2005  level  by  2020.  In  addition,  Ireland  has  a  target  for  the  non-ETS  sectors  to |reduce GHG emissions by 20 per cent relative to the 2005 level.  ||5. |In  her  presentation,  Ms.  Woods  highlighted  that  Ireland  is  making  progress  in  its |contribution to the joint EU emission reduction target, including through the possible use of |units  from  market-based  mechanisms  under  the  Convention.  Key  PaMs  put  in  place  to |achieve  Ireland’s  targets  include:  a  carbon  tax,  in  place  since  2009;  private  car  taxation |based  on  CO2  emissions,  in  place  since  2008;  feed-in  tariffs  for  renewable  energy; |improved  building  standards;  and  afforestation  and  improved  land  management.  In |addition,  Ireland  is  focusing  on  agricultural  research  since  the  agriculture  sector  is |responsible for about 45 per cent of Ireland’s GHG emissions from the non-ETS sectors. ||6. |The opening presentation was followed by interventions and questions from  Brazil, |India and New Zealand. The questions were on: the quantification of the effects of Ireland’s |PaMs; Ireland’s plans to use clean development mechanism (CDM) credits to comply with |its  targets  and  whether  it  restricts  the  purchase  of  CDM  credits  to  specific  developing |countries;  and  Ireland’s  smarter  travel  policy  in  the  context  of  reducing  GHG  emissions |from the transport sector. In response, Ireland provided further explanations. Details can be |found in the webcast of this session on the IAR web page for Ireland. ||1  <http://unfccc.int/8824.php>. ||42 ||                                                           | |FCCC/SBI/2015/10 ||Summary report on multilateral assessment of Japan ||The  first  MA  of  Japan  took  place  on  4 June  2015.  Japan  was  represented  by  Mr. |1. |Hideaki  Mizukoshi,  Deputy  Director-General,  International  Cooperation  Bureau,  Ministry |of Foreign Affairs. ||2. |Questions for Japan  had been submitted in  writing two months before the  working |group  session  by  Australia,  Belgium,  Brazil,  China,  the  EU,  New  Zealand,  Saudi  Arabia, |Switzerland,  the  United  Kingdom  and  the  United  States.  A  list  of  the  questions  received |and the answers provided by Japan can be found on the IAR web page for Japan.1 ||Mr. Mizukoshi made an opening presentation, summarizing Japan’s progress in  the |3. |implementation of its emission reduction and removal commitments related to its quantified |economy-wide emission reduction targets.  ||4. |Mr.  Mizukoshi  presented  Japan’s  GHG  emission  trends  by  sector  and  by  gas  and |explained how they are linked to changes in national circumstances, more specifically the |Great  East  Japan  Earthquake,  which  led  to  the  shutdown  of  Japan’s  48  nuclear  power |stations.  He  also  explained  how  changes  in  national  circumstances  modified  the  trend  in |electricity supply sources, the energy consumption pattern and the GHG emission intensity |of the economy. ||5. |Furthermore,  Mr.  Mizukoshi  reported  that  Japan  achieved  its  emission  reduction |target for the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol using removals by forests and |other  carbon  sinks,  as  well  as  units  from  mechanisms  under  the  Kyoto  Protocol.  He  then |presented  Japan’s  quantified  economy-wide  GHG  emission  reduction  target  for  2020  and |its underlying assumptions, followed by emission projections by sector and by gas for up to |2020.  He  explained  the  main  PaMs  on  which  Japan  relies  to  reduce  emissions  (the  Basic |Environment  Law  and  Basic  Environment  Plan,  and  the  Act  on  Promotion  of  Global |Warming Countermeasures)  and presented the  joint crediting  mechanism that Japan plans |to use to achieve its 2020 target. ||the  Kyoto  Protocol;  civil-society  actions,  a ||6. |The  opening  presentation  was  followed  by  interventions  and  questions  from |Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Fiji, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, Saudi |Arabia, the United Kingdom and the United States. The questions were on: Japan’s revision |of its 2020 target (3.8 per cent below  the 2005 emission level) and how Japan will ensure |that the target will not be weakened; Japan’s participation in the second commitment period |of |low-carbon  society  and  regional |development;  Japan’s  plans  for  the  future  use  of  its  nuclear  energy  production  capacity; |Japan’s strategy for reducing emissions from shipping; the estimated quantitative mitigation |effects of Japan’s PaMs and the PaMs that are expected to contribute the most to reducing |emissions; and the joint crediting mechanism (the rationale behind it, how credits would be |shared  among  Parties,  and  the  independent  nature  of  the  verification  of,  and  accounting |rules for, the mechanism). Questions were also raised in relation to the Party’s assessment |of  the  social  and  economic  consequences  of  its  response  measures.  In  response,  Japan |provided  further  explanations.  Details  can  be  found  in  the  webcast  of  this  session  on  the |IAR web page for Japan. ||1  <http://unfccc.int/8825.php>. ||43 || |                                                           | |FCCC/SBI/2015/10 ||Summary report on multilateral assessment of Liechtenstein ||The  first  MA  of  Liechtenstein  took  place  on  5  June  2015.  Liechtenstein  was ||1. |represented by Ms. Heike Summer, Office of Environment. ||2. |Questions  for  Liechtenstein  had  been  submitted  in  writing  two  months  before  the |working group session by Brazil, China, the EU and the Netherlands. A list of the questions |received and the answers provided by Liechtenstein can be found on the IAR web page for |Liechtenstein.1  ||targets.  She  outlined ||3. |Ms.  Summer  made  an  opening  presentation,  summarizing  Liechtenstein’s  progress |in  the  implementation  of  its  emission  reduction  and  removal  commitments  related  to  its |the  national |reduction |quantified  economy-wide  emission |circumstances of Liechtenstein, which is a very small country with small and medium-sized |enterprises  and  an  export-oriented  economy.  She  explained  that,  although  its  impact  on |global  emissions  is  insignificant,  Liechtenstein  takes  its  commitments  regarding  climate |change seriously. Liechtenstein’s economy-wide emission reduction target corresponds to a |20  per  cent  emission  reduction  by  2020  compared  with  the  1990  level.  Although |Liechtenstein experienced significant economic and population growth, by 230 and 25 per |cent, respectively, between 1990 and 2012, the emission level in 2012 was slightly below |the level in 1990. ||4. |Given  that  Lichtenstein’s  energy  sector  contributed  84  per  cent  of  its  total  GHG |emissions  in  2012,  Liechtenstein’s  PaMs  are  targeted  mainly  at  that  sector.  The  most |important  supporting  legislation  includes:  the  Emissions  Trading  Act,  which  stipulates |Liechtenstein’s  participation  in  the  EU  ETS;  the  Energy  Efficiency  Act,  which  regulates |financial support for energy efficiency measures and measures to increase the share of RES; |and the Carbon Dioxide Act. A new version of the National Climate Strategy is expected by |the end of 2015. In addition, Liechtenstein has been investing in photovoltaic installations |since 2008, resulting in an installed capacity increase from 1,170 MWh in 2009 to 15,550 |MWh  in  2014.  Other  measures  that  are  specific  to  the  national  circumstances  of |Liechtenstein  include  the  commissioning  of  a  wood-fired  power  station  and  a  steam |pipeline  from  a  waste  incineration  plant  in  neighbouring  Switzerland.  Regarding  forests, |Ms. Summer explained that wooded area comprises 41 per cent of Liechtenstein’s total area |and that most of the forest is protected forest with provisions that prohibit deforestation.  ||5. |The opening presentation was followed by interventions and questions from  Brazil, |China, the Netherlands and New Zealand. The questions related to: Liechtenstein’s plans to |use  units  from  market-based  mechanisms  to  achieve  its  emission  reduction  targets; |additional measures planned to achieve its targets; the relationship between its target under |the Convention and that under the Kyoto Protocol; the implementation status and expected |effect  of  its  infrastructure  measures  relating  to  railways;  and  the  contribution  of |Liechtenstein’s  mitigation  actions  to  the  observed  trend  in  the  emission  intensity  of  its |economy. In response, Liechtenstein provided further explanations. Details can be found in |the webcast of this session on the IAR web page for Liechtenstein. ||1  <http://unfccc.int/8826.php>. ||44 ||                                                           | |FCCC/SBI/2015/10 ||Summary report on multilateral assessment of Lithuania ||The first MA of Lithuania took place on 5 June 2015. Lithuania was represented by ||1. |Ms. Stasile Znutiene, Ministry of Environment. ||2. |Questions  for  Lithuania  had  been  submitted  in  writing  two  months  before  the |working group session by China. A list of the questions received and the answers provided |by Lithuania can be found on the IAR web page for Lithuania.1 ||3. |Ms.  Znutiene  made  an  opening  presentation,  summarizing  Lithuania’s  progress  in |implementation towards the achievement of emission reductions and removals related to its |quantified  economy-wide  emission  reduction  targets.  GHG  emissions  excluding  the |LULUCF sector in Lithuania in 2012 showed a decrease of 55.6 per cent compared with the |1990  level,  while  GDP  increased  by  25  per  cent  over  the  same  period,  indicating  a |decoupling  of  GHG  emissions  from  economic  growth.  According  to  Ms.  Znutiene, |Lithuania overachieved its emission reduction target for the first commitment period of the |Kyoto Protocol.  ||4. |Ms.  Znutiene presented  Lithuania’s 2020 targets at a disaggregated level, covering |its  targets  under  the  EU  ETS  and  for  sectors  outside  the  EU  ETS,  as  well  as  targets  for |renewable energy, biofuels in transport and improvements in energy efficiency. According |to historical data  and current  GHG  emission projections, Lithuania is on track to  meet its |targets.  By  2012  energy  consumption  in  Lithuania  had  reduced  by  almost  5 per  cent |compared  with  the  2009  level,  while  nearly  21.7  per  cent  of  the  total  energy  consumed |came  from  RES,  against  the  target  of  23 per  cent  by  2020.  For  the  non-ETS  sectors, |Lithuania is on track to meet its 2020 target with the use of additional measures. Key PaMs |are  in  place  to  ensure  the  achievement  of  Lithuania’s  2020  targets,  including  the |overarching  National  Strategy  for  Climate  Change  Management  Policy  for  the  period |2013–2050, the  Action Plan to operationalize the Strategy  for the period 2013–2020, and |sector-specific  PaMs,  as  well  as  related  economic  instruments  and  financial  support |mechanisms.  ||5. |The opening presentation was followed by interventions and questions from Brazil, |China, India and  the Republic of Korea. The questions were on: Lithuania’s further plans |and policies to reduce emissions from the transport and agriculture sectors; the key drivers |for the 56 per cent decrease in GHG emissions by 2012 compared with the 1990 level; the |main reasons  for the sharp decrease in GHG emissions during the  period 1990–1992; the |coverage  of  tariff  subsidies  as  an  economic  instrument;  and  the  development  of  RES, |including the institutional mechanism in place and specific policies on biofuel. In response, |Lithuania provided further explanations. Details can be found in the webcast of this session |on the IAR web page for Lithuania. ||1  <http://unfccc.int/8870.php>.  ||45 || |                                                           | |FCCC/SBI/2015/10 ||Summary report on multilateral assessment of Malta ||The  first  MA  of  Malta  took  place  on  5 June  2015.  Malta  was  represented  by  Ms. |1. |Simone Borg, Ambassador of the Ministry for Sustainable Development, the Environment |and Climate Change, and Ms. Claire Qoul from the same ministry. ||2. |Questions for Malta had been submitted in  writing two months before the  working |group  session  by  Brazil  and  China.  A  list  of  the  questions  received  and  the  answers |provided by Malta can be found on the IAR web page for Malta.1  ||3. |Ms.  Borg  made  an  opening  presentation,  summarizing  Malta’s  progress  in |implementation towards the achievement of emission reductions and removals related to its |quantified  economy-wide  emission  reduction  targets.  She  elaborated  on  the  national |circumstances of Malta, which are key to explaining the emission profile of Malta and the |country’s  limited  potential  in  the  development  of  RES.  The  GHG  emission  intensity |decreased  by  56  per  cent  in  2012  compared  with  the  1990  level,  while  national  GDP  per |capita increased by 260 per cent, indicating a decoupling of GHG emissions from economic |growth in Malta. ||4. |Ms.  Qoul  presented  Malta’s  target  for  2020  in  the  context  of  the  EU  climate  and |energy package, with an emphasis on Malta’s emission reduction target for sectors outside |the EU ETS. As a member State of the EU, Malta has a target under the ESD to limit the |growth of its emissions in the non-ETS sectors by 5 per cent by 2020 compared  with the |2005  level.  Despite  the  limited  mitigation  potential  in  Malta,  the  existing  PaMs  in  the |transport, agriculture and waste sectors are projected to produce mitigation effects that will |keep Malta on track to meet its 2020 target for sectors outside the EU ETS. In addition, Ms. |Qoul  elaborated  on  the  Party’s  PaMs  in  electricity  generation,  which  will  make  a  major |contribution to the overall GHG emission reduction in Malta in the lead-up to 2030. ||The opening presentation was followed by interventions and questions from Algeria, |5. |Botswana and China. These questions were on the limited potential for the development of |large-scale and centralized RES and of distributed RES, and the drivers of the decrease in |GHG emissions during 2015–2016. A point was also raised on Malta’s financial support for |the  efforts  of  developing  countries  to  tackle  climate  change.  In  response,  Malta  provided |further  explanations.  Details  can  be  found  in  the  webcast  of  this  session  on  the  IAR  web |page for Malta. ||1  <http://unfccc.int/8827.php>. ||46 || | | |                                                           | |FCCC/SBI/2015/10 ||Summary report on multilateral assessment of Monaco ||The  first  MA  of  Monaco  took  place  on  5 June  2015.  Monaco  was  represented  by ||1. |Mr. Patrick Rolland, Department of the Environment. ||2. |Questions for Monaco had been submitted in writing two months before the working |group session by Brazil, China, the EU and the Netherlands. A list of the questions received |and the answers provided by Monaco can be found on the IAR web page for Monaco.2  ||3. |Mr. Rolland made an opening presentation, summarizing Monaco’s progress in the |implementation of its emission reduction and removal commitments related to its quantified |economy-wide  emission  reduction  targets.  He  explained  the  national  circumstances  of |Monaco,  which is a very  small country and a net importer of energy. Energy is the  main |source  of  GHG  emissions  in  Monaco,  contributing  more  than  90  per  cent  of  its  total |emissions and originating in equal shares from waste incineration, buildings and transport. |Since 2000 a gradual decrease in emissions has been observed, which led to emissions in |2012 being 13 per cent lower than the base year level, compared with its target of an 8 per |cent emission reduction for the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. The  main |PaMs contributing to the emission decrease include: a cap on the annual waste capacity of |the  waste  incineration  plant;  urban  renewal;  the  banning  of  domestic  fuel  boilers  in  new |buildings; and the clean mobility policy. ||4. |Regarding  its  mitigation  targets  under  the  Convention,  Monaco  is  committed  to |reducing its emissions by 30 per cent by 2020 and by 80 per cent by 2050 compared with |the 1990 level, and to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. LULUCF is not accounted for |as  it  comprises  only  0.04  per  cent  of  Monaco’s  total  annual  emissions.  In  addition  to  its |climate  commitments,  Monaco  is  also  committed  to  increasing  energy  efficiency  in |buildings  by  20  per  cent,  to  achieving  a  20  per  cent  share  of  RES  in  its  final  energy |production and to keeping electricity consumption stable by 2020. To achieve those targets, |Monaco implemented its Energy and Climate Action Plan. According to its GHG emission |projections,  meeting  its  targets  by  2020  will  not  be  ensured  by  domestic  emission |reductions alone. Hence, Monaco is currently defining and implementing additional PaMs |to achieve its 2020 and longer-term targets, including: the prevention of waste production |and  the  renewal  of  the  waste  treatment  facility;  the  promotion  of  clean  vehicles,  soft |mobility  and  infrastructure  for  intra-urban  logistics;  and,  in  buildings,  the  gradual |substitution of fossil fuels for renewable energy along with energy efficiency measures.  ||5. |The opening presentation was followed by interventions and questions from Brazil, |China,  India,  New  Zealand,  the  Republic  of  Korea  and  the  United  Republic  of  Tanzania. |The  questions  related  to:  PaMs  to  reduce  emissions  from  transport;  PaMs  to  increase  the |share  of  biofuels;  subsidies  for  domestic  households;  measures  to  reduce  electricity |consumption,  also  targeting  the  import  of  electricity;  emission  trends  in  the  most  recent |years; Monaco’s participation in activities related to reducing emissions from international |aviation; and how emission reduction efforts in Monaco are influenced by its dependency |on  international  and  cross-border  cooperation.  In  response,  Monaco  provided  further |explanations. Details can be found in the webcast of this session on the IAR web page for |Monaco. ||2  <http://unfccc.int/8828.php>. ||47 || |                                                           | |FCCC/SBI/2015/10 ||Summary report on multilateral assessment of Norway ||The first MA of Norway took place on 5 June 2015. Norway was represented by Mr. ||1. |Peer Stiansen, Senior Adviser, Ministry of Climate and Environment. ||2. |Questions for Norway had been submitted in writing two months before the working |group session by Brazil, Canada, China, the EU, New Zealand, Switzerland and the United |States. A list of the questions received and the answers provided by Norway can be found |on the IAR web page for Norway.1  ||3. |Mr.  Stiansen  made  an  opening  presentation,  summarizing  Norway’s  progress  in |implementation towards the achievement of emission reductions and removals related to its |quantified economy-wide emission reduction targets. ||4. |Under  the  Convention,  Norway  made  a  commitment  to  reduce  its  GHG  emissions |by  30  per  cent  by  2020  compared  with  the  1990  level.  This  target  will  be  reached  by |Norway through its commitment for the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, |with average annual emissions over the period 2013–2020 projected to be at 84 per cent of |the  1990  level.  Mr.  Stiansen  highlighted  Norway’s  long-term  objective  to  become  a  low-|emission  society  and  reach  carbon  neutrality  by  2050  (2030  if  part  of  an  ambitious  new |global climate agreement).  ||5. |In  his  presentation  Mr.  Stiansen  outlined  that  Norway  is  on  track  to  achieve  its |emission  reduction  target  under  the  Convention.  Achieving  it  will  require  enhanced |domestic  efforts  as  well  as  the  use  of  units  from  market-based  mechanisms  under  the |Convention,  both  by  purchasing  assigned  amount  units  and  certified  emission |reductions/emission  reduction  units  through  the  EU  ETS  and  by  purchasing  CDM  credits |through the Norwegian purchase programme.  ||6.  With  regard  to  Norway’s  key  domestic  PaMs,  Mr.  Stiansen  stated  that  Norway  is |building its climate change policy based on a comprehensive set of PaMs, with some 80 per |cent of its emissions being already subject to fiscal and economic instruments (carbon taxes |and/or emissions trading). Most notable in the Norwegian policy mix are  CO2 taxes in the |transport |taxes  on |hydrofluorocarbons/perfluorocarbons, and the EU ETS, which covers more than 50 per cent |of Norway’s domestic emissions. In addition, Mr. Stiansen emphasized the importance of |advancing CO2 capture and storage technologies for achieving Norway’s long-term goal of |reaching carbon neutrality.  ||the  offshore  petroleum ||equivalent ||sector, ||sector ||and ||The opening presentation was followed by interventions and questions from Brazil, |7. |China,  the  EU,  Fiji,  India,  Japan,  New  Zealand,  the  Republic  of  Korea,  Samoa,  South |Africa, Switzerland and the United States.

Poland  was  represented  by ||1. |Ms. Sylwia Waśniewska, Institute of Environmental Protection. ||2. |Questions for Poland had been submitted in writing two months before the working |group session by Brazil, China, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland and  the United States. A list of |the questions received and the answers provided by Poland can be found on the IAR web |page for Poland.1 ||3. |Ms. Waśniewska  made an opening presentation, summarizing Poland’s progress in |the  implementation  of  its  emission  reduction  and  removal  commitments  related  to  its |quantified  economy-wide  emission  reduction  targets.  GHG  emissions  in  Poland  had |decreased  by  29  per  cent  by  2012  compared  with  the  base  year  level.  Thus,  Poland’s |emissions are well below its target for the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, |which  corresponds  to  an  emission  reduction  of  6  per  cent  compared  with  the  base  year |level.  While  emissions  decreased,  GDP  increased  significantly  over  the  same  period, |signalling  a  decoupling  of  GDP  from  emission  growth,  owing  to  economic  and |technological changes and a  significant drop in the  emission intensity of Poland’s energy |use. Poland is committed to contributing to the target of the EU under the Convention and |its Kyoto Protocol of a 20 per cent reduction in emissions by 2020 compared with the 1990 |level. In accordance with the ESD, Poland has a target to limit the growth in its emissions |from the non-ETS sectors to 14 per cent by 2020 compared  with the 2005 level (+14 per |cent).  In  addition,  Ms. Waśniewska  explained  Poland’s  targets  regarding  the  share  of |renewables  in  its  final  energy  consumption,  the  share  of  biofuels  in  transport  fuel,  and |energy efficiency. ||4. |According to its GHG emission projections, Poland expects emission levels that are |32  per  cent  lower  in  2020  and  36  per  cent  lower  in  2030  than  the  base  year  level,  with |emissions from energy and agriculture expected to decrease the most. Also, emissions from |the  non-ETS  sectors  are  expected  to  stay  well  below  the  target  trajectory,  reflecting  the |target under the ESD for 2020. Thus, Poland expects to meet its emission reduction targets |with  domestic  measures  only.  Ms. Waśniewska  presented  the  key  elements  of  the  Polish |climate  policy,  including  its  main  strategies,  the  Energy  Policy  of  Poland  until  2030,  the |Renewable  Energy  Sources  Act  and  the  National  Energy  Efficiency  Action  Plan.  In |addition, she explained that the energy policy is currently being updated. It will be extended |to 2050 and will be published in 2016. She further explained that the National Programme |for  the  Development  of  a  Low-Emission  Economy,  which  aims  to  identify  key  areas  for |emission reductions, will be published in 2015. ||5. |The  opening  presentation  was  followed  by  interventions  and  questions  from |Australia,  Brazil,  China,  the  Republic  of  Korea,  Saudi  Arabia  and  the  United  States. |Questions were raised regarding: the envisaged shares of different energy sources including |nuclear  energy  in  Poland’s  final  energy  consumption  by  2020  and  2030  according  to  the |new  energy  policy;  whether  some  of  the  PaMs  included  in  the  new  energy  policy  are |expected  to  show  a  mitigation  effect  before  2020;  the  effect  of  Poland’s  PaMs;  specific |PaMs  targeting  emissions  from  coal  use;  the  economic  feasibility  of  CO2  capture  and |storage  in  Poland;  PaMs  in  the  non-ETS  sectors;  and  Poland’s  use  of  units  from  market-|based mechanisms to achieve its targets. Questions were also raised in relation to Poland’s |assessment of the social and economic consequences of its response measures.

A  list  of  the  questions  received  and  the |answers provided by Romania can be found on the IAR web page for Romania.1  ||3. |Ms. Boldea made an opening presentation, summarizing Romania’s  progress in the |implementation of its emission reduction and removal commitments related to its quantified |economy-wide emission reduction targets. Under the Convention, Romania  participates in |the EU joint economy-wide emission reduction target to achieve a 20 per cent reduction in |emissions by 2020 compared with the 1990 (base year) level. The target for the EU and its |member States is formalized in the EU climate and energy package, which includes the EU |ETS and the ESD. Under the ESD, Romania has a target of limiting emission growth to 19 |per cent above the 2005 level by 2020 (+19 per cent) from sectors covered by the ESD. In |line  with  the  EU  approach  to  its  target,  Romania  does  not  include  emissions  or  removals |from  the  LULUCF  sector  in  defining  its  quantified  economy-wide  target.  The  ESD  also |includes binding renewable energy goals and non-binding energy efficiency goals for each |member State. For Romania, it specifies a binding renewable energy goal of a 24 per cent |renewable  energy  share  in  its  gross  total  final  energy  consumption.  Regarding  energy |efficiency,  Romania  has  a  non-binding  goal  to  achieve  30.32  Mtoe  of  primary  energy |consumption by 2020.  ||4. |The  key  policy  framework  related  to  climate  change  in  Romania  is  the  National |Strategy  for  Climate  Change  2013–2020,  which  addresses  the  achievement  of  Romania’s |national objectives and greenhouse gas emission targets for 2020, as well as the adaptation |measures needed to allow society and ecosystems to adapt to climate change. Specifically, |the National Strategy takes into account relevant EU policies, such as the EU climate and |energy  package  referred  to  in  paragraph  5  above.  Romania’s  total  GHG  emissions |excluding emissions and removals from LULUCF decreased by 49.5 per cent between 1990 |and 2011, with projections showing an emission increase up to 2020. Across the EU, it is |expected  that  the  market  mechanism  of  the  EU  ETS  will  guarantee  that  emissions  from |sectors under this scheme (mainly large point sources such as power plants and industrial |facilities) will achieve the 2020 target of 21 per cent below the 2005 level. Under the ESD, |Romania is expected to meet its emission reduction target as well as its renewable energy |and energy efficiency goals.  ||5. |The opening presentation  was followed by interventions and questions  from  China |and  the  Republic  of  Korea.  The  questions  were  related  to  the  drivers  of  Romania’s |projected increase in GHG emissions and the impact of the EU ETS, energy efficiency and |renewable  energy  deployment  on  emission  reductions.  In  response,  Romania  provided |further  explanations.

The  Russian |Federation  was  represented  by  Ms.  Dinara  Gershinkova,  Deputy  Head  of  Special  and |Scientific  Programmes,  Federal  Service  for  Hydrometeorology  and  Environmental |Monitoring ||Questions  for  the  Russian  Federation  had  been  submitted  in  writing  two  months |2. |before  the  working  group  session  by  Brazil,  China,  the  EU,  New Zealand,  Saudi  Arabia, |Sweden, Switzerland and the United States. A list of the questions received and the answers |provided  by  the  Russian  Federation  can  be  found  on  the  IAR  web  page  for  the  Russian |Federation.1  ||to ||its  quantified  economy-wide  emission  reduction ||Ms.  Gershinkova  made  an  opening  presentation,  summarizing ||3. |the  Russian |Federation’s  progress  towards  the  achievement  of  its  emission  limitation  and  reduction |commitment  related |targets. |Ms. Gershinkova  initially  referred  to  the  questions  received  prior  to  the  working  group |session  and  the  answers  provided.  She  then  described  how  the  target  for  the  first |commitment  period  of  the  Kyoto  Protocol  has  been  overachieved  by  a  large  margin,  in |particular  owing  to  the  adoption  of  legislation  for  energy  efficiency  improvement  and |renewable energy development and the results delivered by these policies. Ms. Gershinkova |emphasized  the  observed  decoupling  of  emission  growth  from  economic  growth  in  the |country since 2000, which is also a result of increased energy efficiency and the structural |economic changes that occurred in the Russian Federation. ||Ms. Gershinkova also provided details of the Russian Federation’s target under the |4. |Convention,  which  corresponds  to  the  limitation  of  emissions  to  a  level  of  no  more  than |75.0 per  cent  of  the  1990  level  by  2020.  She  described  the  action  plan  for  2014–2017 |adopted  by  the  Government  containing  economy-wide  measures  that  support  the |achievement  of  this  target,  such  as  State  regulations  on  GHG  emissions  in  various |economic  sectors,  including  carbon  market  mechanisms,  and  indicated  that  the  LULUCF |sector is not included in the target. She further elaborated on PaMs in the LULUCF sector, |highlighting the importance of this sector and its contribution to addressing climate change |in  the  Russian  Federation,  and  the  implementation  of  a  wide  range  of  measures  for  the |sector for the period 2013–2020.  ||5. |Ms.  Gershinkova  indicated  that  the  Russian  Federation  is  on  track  to  achieve  its |target under the Convention, which is supported by different emission projection scenarios |developed  by  independent  groups.  In  the  “with  additional  measures”  scenario,  which |involves measures such as CO2 capture and storage, the Russian Federation would achieve |a level of GHG emissions corresponding to 66.9 per cent of the 1990 level, which is below |the  75.0  per  cent  specified  in  the  target.  She  also  mentioned  that  in  different  emissions |scenarios  for  the  period  2010–2050,  the  net  CO2  removals  by  forests  in  the  Russian |Federation  decrease  gradually.  Finally,  Ms.  Gershinkova  referred  to  the  Russian |Federation’s  submission  on  31 March  2015  of  its  intended  nationally  determined |contribution, which aims to allow the country to move forward on the path of low-carbon |development compatible with the long-term objective of the Convention to stay below the 2 |°C increase in the global average temperature. ||6. |The  opening  presentation  was  followed  by  interventions  and  questions  from |Australia,  Brazil,  China,  the  EU,  Germany,  India,  New  Zealand,  the  Republic  of  Korea, |Saudi Arabia and South Africa. These questions were on: the actions taken to reverse the ||1  <http://unfccc.int/8832.php>. ||52 ||                                                           | |FCCC/SBI/2015/10 ||trend of growing emissions in recent years;  the list of quantitative details of the measures |with  the  greatest  mitigation  potential;  quantitative  estimates  of  mitigation  effects  of |domestic PaMs and the intended use of Kyoto Protocol units in achieving the 2020 target; |the drivers for the increase in net removals in the LULUCF sector since 1994 and relevant |actions;  the  information  on  the  action  plan  2014–2017  and  its  key  measures  to  meet  the |2020  target.  Further  questions  were  on:  the  PaM  put  in  place  to  achieve  the  target  of |reducing  the  energy  intensity  of  the  economy  by  12  per  cent  by  2020  compared  with  the |2007; the programmes implemented and the specific consideration of new technologies in |the Russian Federation to increase the share of renewable energy in road transportation by |up to 35 per cent by 2030 and the share of renewable energy in electricity production by up |to  4.5  per  cent  by  2020;  the  differences  in  the  role  of  local  governments  and  the  central |government  in  the  reduction  of  GHG  emissions;  the  contribution  of  energy  efficiency |improvements as the  major driver to the  total emission reductions in  the country; and the |road map or time schedule for applying additional carbon pricing policies or measures, such |as  carbon  markets  and  carbon  taxation,  and  whether  these  will  be  implemented  before  or |after 2020.  ||7. |There  were  specific  questions  on  reporting,  such  as  the  limited  reporting  on  the |assessment  of  the  mitigation  impact  of  the  key  PaMs  and  their  aggregated  effect  in  the |biennial report. Questions were also raised in relation to the Party’s assessment of the social |and  economic  consequences  of  response  measures.

Slovakia  was  represented  by ||1. |Ms. Helena Princova from the Ministry of the Environment. ||2. |Questions  for  Slovakia  had  been  submitted  in  writing  two  months  before  the |working  group  session  by  Brazil  and  China.  A  list  of  the  questions  received  and  the |answers provided by Slovakia can be found on the IAR web page for Slovakia.1  ||3. |Ms.  Princova  made  an  opening  presentation,  summarizing  Slovakia’s  progress  in |implementation of its emission reduction and removal commitments related to its quantified |economy-wide emission reduction targets. She elaborated on the national circumstances of |Slovakia,  which  is  a  small  landlocked  country  and  a  member  State  of  the  EU.  She |explained that Slovakia’s target for the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol was |overachieved, with emissions 41.7 per cent lower in 2012 than in 1990. This was achieved |mainly through stricter legislation, by introducing best available technologies and by fuel-|switching from coal and oil to natural gas. Altogether, this led to a decoupling of economic |growth  from  the  level  of  GHG  emissions  in  the  period  1990–2012,  during  which  the |emission  intensity  of  Slovakia’s  gross  domestic  product  decreased  by  68  per  cent.  This |trend  continued  during  the  economic  crisis  in  the  late  2000s,  with  emission  intensity |decreasing  by  36 per  cent  between  2005  and  2012.  In  2012,  energy  remained  the  most |significant sector in terms of  GHG  emissions,  with a share of  69.6 per cent of  Slovakia’s |total emissions, and within that sector emissions from transport showed the largest increase. ||4. |Slovakia is committed to contributing to the target of the EU under the Convention |and its Kyoto Protocol of a 20 per cent reduction in emissions by 2020 compared with the |1990  levels.  In  accordance  with  the  ESD,  Slovakia  has  a  target  to  limit  the  growth  in  its |emissions from the non-ETS sectors to 13 per cent by 2020 compared with the 2005 level |(+13 per cent). The PaMs in place to achieve that target focus on improvements in energy |efficiency  and  the  increase  of  the  share  of  renewables.  The  PaMs  include:  the  National |Reform Programme and its  Action Plan,  with targeted sectoral policies, including climate |and  energy  policies;  the  National  Environmental  Strategy;  the  Energy  Security  Strategy; |taxation  of  energy  products  and  electricity;  the  Action  Plan  for  Energy  Efficiency;  the |National  Action  Plan  for  Biomass  Use;  the  National  Renewable  Energy  Action  Plan;  the |Concept  of  Energy  Efficiency  in  Buildings;  the  Waste  Act;  and  the  implementation  of |several  EU-wide  measures.  According  to  Slovakia’s  GHG  emission  projections,  total |emissions, taking into account implemented and adopted PaMs, are expected to decrease by |12.1 per cent by 2020 compared with the 2005 level. Thus, Slovakia considers that it is on |its  way  to  achieving  its  2020  target  for  emissions  from  the  non-ETS  sectors.  In  addition, |Ms.  Princova  explained  that  the  EU  and  its  member  States  are  committed  to  a  binding |target of a reduction in domestic GHG emissions of at least 40 per cent by 2030 compared |with the 1990 level. ||5. |The opening presentation  was followed by interventions and questions  from  China |and  the  Republic  of  Korea.  The  questions  were  related  to  Slovakia’s  renewable  energy |target, PaMs in place to reduce emissions from international aviation and shipping, and the |target  for  the  sectors  covered  by  the  EU  ETS.  In  response,  Slovakia  provided  further |explanations. Details can be found in the webcast of this session on the IAR web page for |Slovakia. ||1  <http://unfccc.int/8833.php>. ||54 || |                                                           | |FCCC/SBI/2015/10 ||Summary report on multilateral assessment of Slovenia ||The  first MA of Slovenia took place on 5 June 2015.  Slovenia  was represented by ||1. |Mr. Uros Vajgl from the Ministry of Agriculture and the Environment. ||2. |Questions  for  Slovenia  had  been  submitted  in  writing  two  months  before  the |working  group  session  by  Brazil  and  China.  A  list  of  the  questions  received  and  the |answers provided by Slovenia can be found on the IAR web page for Slovenia.1  ||3. |Mr.  Vajgl  made  an  opening  presentation,  summarizing  Slovenia’s  progress  in  the |implementation  of  emission  reduction  and  removal  commitments  related  to  its  quantified |economy-wide emission reduction targets. He elaborated on the national circumstances of |Slovenia,  which  is  a  small  country  and  a  member  State  of  the  EU.  Slovenia  already |experienced  warming  of  1.7  °C  between  1961  and  2011  and,  according  to  climate |scenarios, expects significant climate change impacts by 2050, including a further increase |in  temperature  and  an  increased  occurrence  of  extreme  weather  events  like  floods. |Mr. Vajgl explained that Slovenia achieved its target for the first commitment period of the |Kyoto  Protocol,  an  emission  reduction  of  8  per  cent  compared  with  the  1986  (base  year) |level, owing partly to a decoupling of economic growth from the level of GHG emissions in |the  period  1990–2012,  during  which  the  emission  intensity  of  Slovenia’s  gross  domestic |product fell by 40 per cent. He further explained that the biggest emission reductions were |achieved  in  industry  and  transport  and  that  the  economic  crisis  also  contributed  to  those |reductions.  ||4. |Slovenia is committed to contributing to the target of the EU under the Convention |and its Kyoto Protocol of a reduction in emissions of 20 per cent by 2020 compared with |the 1990 level. In accordance with the ESD, Slovenia has a target to limit the growth in its |emissions  from the  non-ETS sectors to 5 per cent by 2020 compared  with the  2005 level |(+5  per  cent).  According  to  its  GHG  emission  projections,  emissions  from  the  non-ETS |sectors, including the effect of implemented and adopted PaMs, are expected to be close to |the trajectory of Slovenia’s target under the ESD. Mr. Vajgl explained that one of the main |challenges  regarding  future  emission  reductions  is  the  transport  sector,  which  contributes |30  per  cent  of  Slovenia’s  total  emissions  and  is  the  sector  where  half  of  the  emission |reductions  required  for  the  non-ETS  sectors  needs  to  happen.  Such  challenges  relate  to |Slovenia being a transit country with dispersed settlements and daily migration flows. Mr. |Vajgl  also  explained  that  additional  PaMs  will  be  needed  for  Slovenia  to  meet  its  target |under  the  ESD;  to  this  end,  in  2014  Slovenia  adopted  the  Operational  Programme  for |Reducing GHG Emissions until 2020 with a View to 2030. The programme covers the non-|ETS  sectors,  sets  indicative  sectoral  targets  and  includes  a  list  of  measures  to  be |implemented.  Mr.  Vajgl  emphasized  that  the  programme  includes  a  target  trajectory  that |‘overshoots’ the target for 2020, which is necessary because of uncertainties in the transport |sector and the need to facilitate the achievement of the 2030 target.  ||5. |The opening presentation was followed by interventions and questions from Brazil, |China and India. The questions related to PaMs encouraging the use of RES and any related |support  schemes,  and  specific  PaMs  to  deal  with  emissions  from  transit  in  the  transport |sector.  In  response,  Slovenia  provided  further  explanations.

Ms. Balbekova initially described the |new  institutional  arrangements  related  to  climate  change  in  the  country,  including  the |national inventory system of Ukraine. She explained the GHG emission trends since 1990 |and  highlighted  the  importance  of  the  energy  sector’s  contribution  to  the  national |emissions, which has driven the observed trend of reduction in these emissions. ||4. |Referring  to  Ukraine’s  target  under  the  Convention,  Ms.  Balbekova  provided |information  on  Ukraine’s  emission  limitation  commitment  for  participating  in  the  second |commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol to an emission level 24 per cent below the 1990 |level by 2020. She described the policy framework and cross-sectoral measures for climate |change  inscribed  in  Ukraine’s  new  strategy  for  sustainable  development  and  the  national |action plan on the implementation of the association agreement with the European Union, |highlighting  measures  in  the  energy,  industry  and  forestry  sectors,  and  provided |information  on  the  impacts  of  the  key  mitigation  actions.  Ms. Balbekova  provided |information on the key assumptions on GDP and fuel consumption used in the three GHG |emission projection scenarios presented in Ukraine’s sixth national communication and first |biennial  report  and  the  results  of  these  scenarios  in  terms  of  GHG  emissions  by  sector. |Finally, Ms. Balbekova provided a summary of the questions received prior to the working |group session and the answers provided.  ||5. |The  opening  presentation  was  followed  by  interventions  and  questions  from |Australia, Brazil, China and the Republic of Korea. These questions were on: the tax code |policy with regard to reductions in land tax and income tax for renewable energy businesses |and  the  renewable  energy  action  plan  and  whether  they  were  related  or  separate  policies; |the plans to assess the economic feasibility of potentially increasing the level of ambition |vis-à-vis development needs; the reasons for the many changes in the removal trends in the |LULUCF  sector;  the  economic  and  ecological  appropriateness  of  the  development  of |renewable energy; the possible additional  measures to address climate change issues; and |the  assessment  of  how  much  of  the  economic  growth  will  be  sacrificed  in  the  “with |measures” and “with additional measures” emission scenarios compared with the baseline |scenario  or  the  “without  measures”  scenario.

He |also  presented  the  United  Kingdom’s  binding  emission  reduction  target  of  80  per  cent |below the 1990 level by 2050, enshrined in the Climate Change Act (2008). ||5. |Mr.  Lyon  further  presented  information  on  the  United  Kingdom’s  national |circumstances  (population,  energy  demand  and  production,  and  GDP),  followed  by |information  on  progress  made  towards  achieving  the  United  Kingdom’s  targets.  More |specifically, he reported on GHG emission trends as well as GHG emissions by sector and |by gas for 2012. The presentation also detailed total and sectoral GHG emission projections |for 2030, including all implemented and adopted policies and measures. Furthermore, total |and  sectoral  GHG  emissions  avoided  as  a  result  of  the  implementation  of  PaMs  were |reported by year (2009–2030). Finally, brief information on domestic adaptation and on the |United Kingdom’s International Climate Fund financing activities was presented. ||6. |The  opening  presentation  was  followed  by  interventions  and  questions  from |Australia, Brazil, China, Fiji, Japan, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, Saudi Arabia and |the United States. The questions were on: the impact of GHG emission reduction efforts on |GDP;  GHG  emission  trends  in  the  waste  and  transport  sectors;  PaMs  related  to  future |technological  development,  the  production  of  renewable  energy,  the  built  environment, |transportation and domestic and international shipping; and the comparability of the United |Kingdom’s  GHG  emission  reduction  targets  (domestic,  EU,  Kyoto  Protocol  and |Convention) and the progress  made so far in meeting them. Questions were also raised in |relation to the United Kingdom’s assessment of the social and economic consequences of |its  response  measures.  In  response,  the  United  Kingdom  provided  further  explanations. |Details  can  be  found  in  the  webcast  of  this  session  on  the  IAR  web  page  for  the  United |Kingdom. ||1  <http://unfccc.int/8836.php>.  ||57 || |                                                           | |FCCC/SBI/2015/10 ||Annex II ||Guiding questions to monitor and evaluate progress made in the |process to formulate and implement national adaptation plans ||1.
