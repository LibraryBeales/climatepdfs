I.  Opening of the session 

(Agenda item 1) 

The eighth part of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban 
1. 
Platform  for  Enhanced  Action  (ADP)  was  held  at  the  Palais  des  Nations,  Geneva, 
Switzerland, from 8 to 13 February 2015.1 

The  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP,  Mr.  Ahmed  Djoghlaf  (non-Annex  I)  and  Mr.  Daniel 
2. 
Reifsnyder (Annex I), resumed the second session of the ADP  by opening its 15th plenary 
meeting on 8 February 2015. They welcomed all Parties and observers as well as Ms. Yang 
Liu (non-Annex I), Rapporteur of the ADP.2 

A  statement  was  made  by  Mr.  Manuel  Pulgar-Vidal  (Peru),  President  of  the 
3. 
twentieth  session  of  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  (COP)  and  the  tenth  session  of  the 
Conference  of  the  Parties  serving  as  the  meeting  of  the  Parties  to  the  Kyoto  Protocol 
(CMP). 

The  Co-Chairs  informed  Parties  of  the  meetings  and  consultations  they  had  held 
4. 
with negotiating groups prior to the session, and voiced confidence that the promises made 
at  the  United  Nations  Climate  Change  Conference  held  in  Lima,  Peru,  would  be 
collectively fulfilled, including by concluding an ambitious and universal agreement at the 
United Nations Climate Change Conference to be held in in Paris, France. 

5. 
In  the  interest  of  fulfilling  the  mandate  given  in  decision  1/CP.17,  the  Co-Chairs 
encouraged Parties to convert the ‘elements’ text that emerged from the  Lima Conference 
into  the  negotiating  text  that  would  furnish  the  basis  for  work  in  2015  by  Friday,  13 
February. 

6. 
Statements  were submitted by representatives of 14 Parties, including on behalf of 
the  Group of 77 and  China, the European Union and its 28  member States, the Umbrella 
Group, the Environmental Integrity Group, the African Group, the Alliance of Small Island 
States, the least developed countries, the BASIC countries (Brazil, China, India and South

Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America – Peoples’ Trade Treaty, the League of 
Arab  States,  the  Independent  Association  for  Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean  and  the 
Caribbean Community.3 

7. 
Parties  demonstrated  great  initiative  and  a  spirit  of  cooperation  by  opting  to  post 
their  group  statements  on  the  web  rather  than  reading  them  aloud,  thereby  allowing  the 
work on substantive issues to start immediately.4

II.  Organizational matters 

(Agenda item 2) 

A.  Adoption of the agenda 

(Agenda item 2(b)) 

The  agenda  for  the  second  session  of  the  ADP  was  adopted  by  the  ADP  at  the  1st 

8. 
meeting of the session, on 29 April 2013.5 

B.  Organization of the work of the session 

(Agenda item 2(c)) 

At the 15th meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the delegates’ attention to the scenario note 
9. 
prepared for the eighth part of the session,6 and outlined the arrangements made in the light 
of  the  organization  of  work  previously  agreed  by  the  ADP,  the  mandates  of  the  ADP, 
including those given at COP 197 and 20,8 and pre-sessional consultations. The organization 
of the work on agenda item 3 included a contact group established at the fourth part of the 
session,9 a briefing on support for domestic preparations for intended nationally determined 
contributions  (INDCs)  and  a  dedicated  meeting  on  ways  and  means  to  advance  the 
technical  examination  process  in  2015.  The  ADP  decided  to  proceed  on  the  basis  of  the 
organization of work proposed by the Co-Chairs. 

10.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  stressed  the  importance  of  time  management 
and of collaboration among Parties for the success of the collective work at this session.  

11. 
In  addition,  the  Co-Chairs  held  a  special  event  with  observer  organizations  during 
the session, on 12 February.10 Representatives of observer organizations welcomed the new 
ADP Co-Chairs, and expressed interest in continuing such special events in 2015. The ADP 
Co-Chairs  underscored  the  intergovernmental  nature  of  the  ADP  and  its  work,  and 
encouraged  observer  organizations  to  bring  forward  ideas  to  governments  for  further 
engaging in the process and strengthening implementation. 

III.  Implementation of all the elements of decision 1/CP.17 

(Agenda item 3) 

The  ADP  considered  this  agenda  item  at  its  15th  meeting,  as  well  as  at  its  16th 
12. 
meeting, held on 13 February. It had before it decision 1/CP.20, the report of the ADP on 
the seventh part of its second session,11 and the informal note prepared for the eighth part of 
the session.12 

13.  At  the  15th  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  recalled  that  the  COP  requested  the  ADP  to 
intensify its work with a view to making available a negotiating text for a protocol, another 
legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to

all  Parties  before  May  2015.13  The  Co-Chairs  reminded  Parties  that  this  negotiating  text 
was  to  be  derived  from  the  annex  to  decision  1/CP.20,  titled  “Lima  Call  for  Climate 
Action.” They noted that this text was to fully reflect the positions of all Parties. 

In accordance with this deadline, the Co-Chairs stressed their commitment to deliver 
14. 
and make available the negotiating text of the 2015 agreement by the closing plenary, on 13 
February. 

The Co-Chairs called upon the ADP to streamline the text’s language and eliminate 
15. 
redundancies  and  duplications,  better  present  alternatives  and  divergences,  and  clarify,  to 
the extent possible, proposals and concepts contained therein. 

16. 
In the interest of further refining the text over the course of future sessions, the Co-
Chairs  encouraged  Parties  to  consider  what  language  in  the  existing  text  might  be  most 
suitable  for  the  agreement,  and  what  might  be  more  appropriate  for  accompanying 
decisions. 

17. 
The  ADP  worked  sequentially  through  the  language  of  the  annex  to  decision 
1/CP.20 in an effort to develop the negotiating text. Each section was updated and further 
revised as requested by Parties, in an open and transparent manner.  Each revised iteration 
of the text was made available on the UNFCCC website. On 12 February, the sections were 
consolidated into a single document and made available as an advance unedited version on 
the UNFCCC website.14 

18. 
Further, in the context of its work on agenda item 3, the contact group referred to in 
paragraph  9  above  held  meetings  to  explore  broader  substantive  questions  related  to  the 
2015 agreement and ideas on how to make significant progress in the June session.15 The 
Co-Chairs informed Parties of their intention to issue a scenario note in order to facilitate 
preparations for that June session. 

19. 
In  the  context  of  work  on  pre-2020  climate  action,  including  on  how  to  further 
advance workstream 2, the contact group exchanged views on how to implement decision 
1/CP.19,  in  particular  paragraphs  3–5,  and  decision  1/CP.20,  in  particular  paragraphs  17–
20.  The  ADP  held  a  dedicated  meeting  on  how  to  advance  the  technical  examination 
process on 10 February.16  

20.  At  the  16th  meeting,  the  ADP  had  before  it  the  advance  unedited  version  of  the 
negotiating text, referred to in the last sentence of paragraph 17 above, and agreed that this 
text accurately reflects the proposals of all Parties and is the negotiating text that the ADP 
will use to start substantive negotiations at its next session. 

Following 

the  COP  mandate, 

the  Co-Chairs  requested 

to 
21. 
communicate  the  negotiating  text,  referred  to  in  paragraph  17  above,  to  Parties  in 
accordance  with  provisions  of  the  Convention  and  the  draft  rules  of  procedure  being 
applied, while noting that such communication will not prejudice whether the outcome will 
be  a  protocol,  another  legal  instrument  or  an  agreed  outcome  with  legal  force  under  the 
Convention applicable to all Parties.17

22.  Also  at  the  16th  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  provided  information  on  the  briefing  on 
support  for  domestic  preparations  for  INDCs  facilitated  by  Mr.  Roberto  Dondisch 
Glowinski  (Mexico).18  In  the  light  of  the  invitation  to  all  Parties  to  communicate  their

INDCs well in advance of COP 21 (by the first quarter of 2015 by those Parties ready to do 
so),19 the objective of the briefing, which took place on 9 February, was to update Parties on 
progress  in  delivering  existing  support  and  to  inform  Parties  of  other,  new  sources  of 
support for the preparation of INDCs. 

23.  At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs recalled that the ADP agreed to hold at least one 
additional session in the second half of 2015.20 The Co-Chairs requested the secretariat to 
make the necessary arrangements to organize two additional five-day sessions in the second 
half  of  the  year  in  Bonn,  Germany,  from  31  August  to  4  September  and  from  19  to  23 
October 2015. 

24. 
The  Co-Chairs  invited  the  secretariat  to  provide  delegates  with  information  on  the 
administrative  and  financial  implications  of,  and  on  the  status  of  funding  for,  additional 
sessions of the ADP in 2015. The Executive Secretary informed Parties that the secretariat 
has secured a venue for the two additional sessions of the ADP and that a total of USD 2 
million was still needed for these sessions. 

Statements  were  made  on  behalf  of  the  Presidency  of  COP  20/CMP  10  and  on 

25. 
behalf of the European Union and its 28 member States. 

IV.  Report on the eighth part of the second session 

(Agenda item 5) 

26.  At its 16th meeting, the ADP considered and adopted the draft report on the eighth 
part of its second session.21 At the same meeting, on a proposal of the Co-Chairs, the ADP 
authorized the Rapporteur to complete the report on the eighth part of the session, with the 
assistance of the secretariat and under the guidance of the Co-Chairs. 

V.  Suspension of the session 

27.  At its 16th meeting, the ADP agreed to the proposal of the Co-Chairs to suspend the 
second session and resume it in conjunction with the forty-second sessions of the subsidiary 
bodies in Bonn. 

28.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP  expressed  their  appreciation  to 
Parties for their work and support, and declared the second session of the ADP suspended.

all  Parties  before  May  2015.13  The  Co-Chairs  reminded  Parties  that  this  negotiating  text 
was  to  be  derived  from  the  annex  to  decision  1/CP.20,  titled  “Lima  Call  for  Climate 
Action.” They noted that this text was to fully reflect the positions of all Parties. 

In accordance with this deadline, the Co-Chairs stressed their commitment to deliver 
14. 
and make available the negotiating text of the 2015 agreement by the closing plenary, on 13 
February. 

The Co-Chairs called upon the ADP to streamline the text’s language and eliminate 
15. 
redundancies  and  duplications,  better  present  alternatives  and  divergences,  and  clarify,  to 
the extent possible, proposals and concepts contained therein. 

16. 
In the interest of further refining the text over the course of future sessions, the Co-
Chairs  encouraged  Parties  to  consider  what  language  in  the  existing  text  might  be  most 
suitable  for  the  agreement,  and  what  might  be  more  appropriate  for  accompanying 
decisions. 

17. 
The  ADP  worked  sequentially  through  the  language  of  the  annex  to  decision 
1/CP.20 in an effort to develop the negotiating text. Each section was updated and further 
revised as requested by Parties, in an open and transparent manner.  Each revised iteration 
of the text was made available on the UNFCCC website. On 12 February, the sections were 
consolidated into a single document and made available as an advance unedited version on 
the UNFCCC website.14 

18. 
Further, in the context of its work on agenda item 3, the contact group referred to in 
paragraph  9  above  held  meetings  to  explore  broader  substantive  questions  related  to  the 
2015 agreement and ideas on how to make significant progress in the June session.15 The 
Co-Chairs informed Parties of their intention to issue a scenario note in order to facilitate 
preparations for that June session. 

19. 
In  the  context  of  work  on  pre-2020  climate  action,  including  on  how  to  further 
advance workstream 2, the contact group exchanged views on how to implement decision 
1/CP.19,  in  particular  paragraphs  3–5,  and  decision  1/CP.20,  in  particular  paragraphs  17–
20.  The  ADP  held  a  dedicated  meeting  on  how  to  advance  the  technical  examination 
process on 10 February.16  

20.  At  the  16th  meeting,  the  ADP  had  before  it  the  advance  unedited  version  of  the 
negotiating text, referred to in the last sentence of paragraph 17 above, and agreed that this 
text accurately reflects the proposals of all Parties and is the negotiating text that the ADP 
will use to start substantive negotiations at its next session. 

Following 

the  COP  mandate, 

the  Co-Chairs  requested 

to 
21. 
communicate  the  negotiating  text,  referred  to  in  paragraph  17  above,  to  Parties  in 
accordance  with  provisions  of  the  Convention  and  the  draft  rules  of  procedure  being 
applied, while noting that such communication will not prejudice whether the outcome will 
be  a  protocol,  another  legal  instrument  or  an  agreed  outcome  with  legal  force  under  the 
Convention applicable to all Parties.17

half  of  the  year  in  Bonn,  Germany,  from  31  August  to  4  September  and  from  19  to  23 
October 2015. 

24. 
The  Co-Chairs  invited  the  secretariat  to  provide  delegates  with  information  on  the 
administrative  and  financial  implications  of,  and  on  the  status  of  funding  for,  additional 
sessions of the ADP in 2015. The Executive Secretary informed Parties that the secretariat 
has secured a venue for the two additional sessions of the ADP and that a total of USD 2 
million was still needed for these sessions. 

Statements  were  made  on  behalf  of  the  Presidency  of  COP  20/CMP  10  and  on 

25.

I.  Opening of the session 

(Agenda item 1) 

The eighth part of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban 
1. 
Platform  for  Enhanced  Action  (ADP)  was  held  at  the  Palais  des  Nations,  Geneva, 
Switzerland, from 8 to 13 February 2015.1 

The  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP,  Mr.  Ahmed  Djoghlaf  (non-Annex  I)  and  Mr.  Daniel 
2. 
Reifsnyder (Annex I), resumed the second session of the ADP  by opening its 15th plenary 
meeting on 8 February 2015. They welcomed all Parties and observers as well as Ms. Yang 
Liu (non-Annex I), Rapporteur of the ADP.2 

A  statement  was  made  by  Mr.  Manuel  Pulgar-Vidal  (Peru),  President  of  the 
3. 
twentieth  session  of  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  (COP)  and  the  tenth  session  of  the 
Conference  of  the  Parties  serving  as  the  meeting  of  the  Parties  to  the  Kyoto  Protocol 
(CMP). 

The  Co-Chairs  informed  Parties  of  the  meetings  and  consultations  they  had  held 
4. 
with negotiating groups prior to the session, and voiced confidence that the promises made 
at  the  United  Nations  Climate  Change  Conference  held  in  Lima,  Peru,  would  be 
collectively fulfilled, including by concluding an ambitious and universal agreement at the 
United Nations Climate Change Conference to be held in in Paris, France. 

5. 
In  the  interest  of  fulfilling  the  mandate  given  in  decision  1/CP.17,  the  Co-Chairs 
encouraged Parties to convert the ‘elements’ text that emerged from the  Lima Conference 
into  the  negotiating  text  that  would  furnish  the  basis  for  work  in  2015  by  Friday,  13 
February. 

6. 
Statements  were submitted by representatives of 14 Parties, including on behalf of 
the  Group of 77 and  China, the European Union and its 28  member States, the Umbrella 
Group, the Environmental Integrity Group, the African Group, the Alliance of Small Island 
States, the least developed countries, the BASIC countries (Brazil, China, India and South 
Africa),  the  Like-minded  Developing  Countries,  the  Coalition  for  Rainforest  Nations,  the 
Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America – Peoples’ Trade Treaty, the League of 
Arab  States,  the  Independent  Association  for  Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean  and  the 
Caribbean Community.3 

7. 
Parties  demonstrated  great  initiative  and  a  spirit  of  cooperation  by  opting  to  post 
their  group  statements  on  the  web  rather  than  reading  them  aloud,  thereby  allowing  the 
work on substantive issues to start immediately.4 

1  The report on the first and second parts of the second session of the ADP is contained in document 
FCCC/ADP/2013/2; the reports on the third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh parts of the second 
session are contained in documents FCCC/ADP/2013/3, FCCC/ADP/2014/1, FCCC/ADP/2014/2,

2  The Bureau of the ADP was elected in accordance with the arrangement set out in document 

FCCC/ADP/2012/2, paragraph 7, which was endorsed by decision 2/CP.18. The ADP elected the 
current members of its Bureau at the seventh part of its second session, as reflected in document 
FCCC/ADP/2014/4.

II.  Organizational matters 

(Agenda item 2) 

A.  Adoption of the agenda 

(Agenda item 2(b)) 

The  agenda  for  the  second  session  of  the  ADP  was  adopted  by  the  ADP  at  the  1st 

8. 
meeting of the session, on 29 April 2013.5 

B.  Organization of the work of the session 

(Agenda item 2(c)) 

At the 15th meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the delegates’ attention to the scenario note 
9. 
prepared for the eighth part of the session,6 and outlined the arrangements made in the light 
of  the  organization  of  work  previously  agreed  by  the  ADP,  the  mandates  of  the  ADP, 
including those given at COP 197 and 20,8 and pre-sessional consultations. The organization 
of the work on agenda item 3 included a contact group established at the fourth part of the 
session,9 a briefing on support for domestic preparations for intended nationally determined 
contributions  (INDCs)  and  a  dedicated  meeting  on  ways  and  means  to  advance  the 
technical  examination  process  in  2015.  The  ADP  decided  to  proceed  on  the  basis  of  the 
organization of work proposed by the Co-Chairs. 

10.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  stressed  the  importance  of  time  management 
and of collaboration among Parties for the success of the collective work at this session.  

11. 
In  addition,  the  Co-Chairs  held  a  special  event  with  observer  organizations  during 
the session, on 12 February.10 Representatives of observer organizations welcomed the new 
ADP Co-Chairs, and expressed interest in continuing such special events in 2015. The ADP 
Co-Chairs  underscored  the  intergovernmental  nature  of  the  ADP  and  its  work,  and

FCCC/ADP/2015/2 

I.  Opening of the session 

(Agenda item 1) 

The eighth part of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban 
1. 
Platform  for  Enhanced  Action  (ADP)  was  held  at  the  Palais  des  Nations,  Geneva, 
Switzerland, from 8 to 13 February 2015.1 

The  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP,  Mr.  Ahmed  Djoghlaf  (non-Annex  I)  and  Mr.  Daniel 
2. 
Reifsnyder (Annex I), resumed the second session of the ADP  by opening its 15th plenary 
meeting on 8 February 2015. They welcomed all Parties and observers as well as Ms. Yang 
Liu (non-Annex I), Rapporteur of the ADP.2 

A  statement  was  made  by  Mr.  Manuel  Pulgar-Vidal  (Peru),  President  of  the 
3. 
twentieth  session  of  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  (COP)  and  the  tenth  session  of  the 
Conference  of  the  Parties  serving  as  the  meeting  of  the  Parties  to  the  Kyoto  Protocol 
(CMP). 

The  Co-Chairs  informed  Parties  of  the  meetings  and  consultations  they  had  held 
4. 
with negotiating groups prior to the session, and voiced confidence that the promises made 
at  the  United  Nations  Climate  Change  Conference  held  in  Lima,  Peru,  would  be 
collectively fulfilled, including by concluding an ambitious and universal agreement at the 
United Nations Climate Change Conference to be held in in Paris, France. 

5. 
In  the  interest  of  fulfilling  the  mandate  given  in  decision  1/CP.17,  the  Co-Chairs 
encouraged Parties to convert the ‘elements’ text that emerged from the  Lima Conference 
into  the  negotiating  text  that  would  furnish  the  basis  for  work  in  2015  by  Friday,  13 
February. 

6. 
Statements  were submitted by representatives of 14 Parties, including on behalf of 
the  Group of 77 and  China, the European Union and its 28  member States, the Umbrella 
Group, the Environmental Integrity Group, the African Group, the Alliance of Small Island 
States, the least developed countries, the BASIC countries (Brazil, China, India and South 
Africa),  the  Like-minded  Developing  Countries,  the  Coalition  for  Rainforest  Nations,  the 
Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America – Peoples’ Trade Treaty, the League of 
Arab  States,  the  Independent  Association  for  Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean  and  the 
Caribbean Community.3 

7. 
Parties  demonstrated  great  initiative  and  a  spirit  of  cooperation  by  opting  to  post 
their  group  statements  on  the  web  rather  than  reading  them  aloud,  thereby  allowing  the 
work on substantive issues to start immediately.4 

1  The report on the first and second parts of the second session of the ADP is contained in document 
FCCC/ADP/2013/2; the reports on the third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh parts of the second 
session are contained in documents FCCC/ADP/2013/3, FCCC/ADP/2014/1, FCCC/ADP/2014/2, 
FCCC/ADP/2014/3 and FCCC/ADP/2014/4, respectively. 

2  The Bureau of the ADP was elected in accordance with the arrangement set out in document 

FCCC/ADP/2012/2, paragraph 7, which was endorsed by decision 2/CP.18. The ADP elected the 
current members of its Bureau at the seventh part of its second session, as reflected in document 
FCCC/ADP/2014/4.

II.  Organizational matters 

(Agenda item 2) 

A.  Adoption of the agenda 

(Agenda item 2(b)) 

The  agenda  for  the  second  session  of  the  ADP  was  adopted  by  the  ADP  at  the  1st 

8. 
meeting of the session, on 29 April 2013.5 

B.  Organization of the work of the session 

(Agenda item 2(c)) 

At the 15th meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the delegates’ attention to the scenario note 
9. 
prepared for the eighth part of the session,6 and outlined the arrangements made in the light 
of  the  organization  of  work  previously  agreed  by  the  ADP,  the  mandates  of  the  ADP, 
including those given at COP 197 and 20,8 and pre-sessional consultations. The organization 
of the work on agenda item 3 included a contact group established at the fourth part of the 
session,9 a briefing on support for domestic preparations for intended nationally determined 
contributions  (INDCs)  and  a  dedicated  meeting  on  ways  and  means  to  advance  the 
technical  examination  process  in  2015.  The  ADP  decided  to  proceed  on  the  basis  of  the 
organization of work proposed by the Co-Chairs. 

10.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  stressed  the  importance  of  time  management 
and of collaboration among Parties for the success of the collective work at this session.  

11. 
In  addition,  the  Co-Chairs  held  a  special  event  with  observer  organizations  during 
the session, on 12 February.10 Representatives of observer organizations welcomed the new 
ADP Co-Chairs, and expressed interest in continuing such special events in 2015. The ADP 
Co-Chairs  underscored  the  intergovernmental  nature  of  the  ADP  and  its  work,  and 
encouraged  observer  organizations  to  bring  forward  ideas  to  governments  for  further 
engaging in the process and strengthening implementation. 

III.  Implementation of all the elements of decision 1/CP.17 

(Agenda item 3) 

The  ADP  considered  this  agenda  item  at  its  15th  meeting,  as  well  as  at  its  16th 
12. 
meeting, held on 13 February. It had before it decision 1/CP.20, the report of the ADP on 
the seventh part of its second session,11 and the informal note prepared for the eighth part of 
the session.12 

13.  At  the  15th  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  recalled  that  the  COP  requested  the  ADP  to 
intensify its work with a view to making available a negotiating text for a protocol, another 
legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to 

5  FCCC/ADP/2013/2, paragraphs 8 and 9.

FCCC/ADP/2015/2 

all  Parties  before  May  2015.13  The  Co-Chairs  reminded  Parties  that  this  negotiating  text 
was  to  be  derived  from  the  annex  to  decision  1/CP.20,  titled  “Lima  Call  for  Climate 
Action.” They noted that this text was to fully reflect the positions of all Parties. 

In accordance with this deadline, the Co-Chairs stressed their commitment to deliver 
14. 
and make available the negotiating text of the 2015 agreement by the closing plenary, on 13 
February. 

The Co-Chairs called upon the ADP to streamline the text’s language and eliminate 
15. 
redundancies  and  duplications,  better  present  alternatives  and  divergences,  and  clarify,  to 
the extent possible, proposals and concepts contained therein. 

16. 
In the interest of further refining the text over the course of future sessions, the Co-
Chairs  encouraged  Parties  to  consider  what  language  in  the  existing  text  might  be  most 
suitable  for  the  agreement,  and  what  might  be  more  appropriate  for  accompanying 
decisions. 

17. 
The  ADP  worked  sequentially  through  the  language  of  the  annex  to  decision 
1/CP.20 in an effort to develop the negotiating text. Each section was updated and further 
revised as requested by Parties, in an open and transparent manner.  Each revised iteration 
of the text was made available on the UNFCCC website. On 12 February, the sections were 
consolidated into a single document and made available as an advance unedited version on 
the UNFCCC website.14 

18. 
Further, in the context of its work on agenda item 3, the contact group referred to in 
paragraph  9  above  held  meetings  to  explore  broader  substantive  questions  related  to  the 
2015 agreement and ideas on how to make significant progress in the June session.15 The 
Co-Chairs informed Parties of their intention to issue a scenario note in order to facilitate 
preparations for that June session. 

19. 
In  the  context  of  work  on  pre-2020  climate  action,  including  on  how  to  further 
advance workstream 2, the contact group exchanged views on how to implement decision 
1/CP.19,  in  particular  paragraphs  3–5,  and  decision  1/CP.20,  in  particular  paragraphs  17–
20.  The  ADP  held  a  dedicated  meeting  on  how  to  advance  the  technical  examination 
process on 10 February.16  

20.  At  the  16th  meeting,  the  ADP  had  before  it  the  advance  unedited  version  of  the 
negotiating text, referred to in the last sentence of paragraph 17 above, and agreed that this 
text accurately reflects the proposals of all Parties and is the negotiating text that the ADP 
will use to start substantive negotiations at its next session. 

Following 

the  COP  mandate, 

the  Co-Chairs  requested 

to 
21. 
communicate  the  negotiating  text,  referred  to  in  paragraph  17  above,  to  Parties  in 
accordance  with  provisions  of  the  Convention  and  the  draft  rules  of  procedure  being 
applied, while noting that such communication will not prejudice whether the outcome will 
be  a  protocol,  another  legal  instrument  or  an  agreed  outcome  with  legal  force  under  the 
Convention applicable to all Parties.17 

the  secretariat 

22.  Also  at  the  16th  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  provided  information  on  the  briefing  on 
support  for  domestic  preparations  for  INDCs  facilitated  by  Mr.  Roberto  Dondisch 
Glowinski  (Mexico).18  In  the  light  of  the  invitation  to  all  Parties  to  communicate  their

INDCs well in advance of COP 21 (by the first quarter of 2015 by those Parties ready to do 
so),19 the objective of the briefing, which took place on 9 February, was to update Parties on 
progress  in  delivering  existing  support  and  to  inform  Parties  of  other,  new  sources  of 
support for the preparation of INDCs. 

23.  At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs recalled that the ADP agreed to hold at least one 
additional session in the second half of 2015.20 The Co-Chairs requested the secretariat to 
make the necessary arrangements to organize two additional five-day sessions in the second 
half  of  the  year  in  Bonn,  Germany,  from  31  August  to  4  September  and  from  19  to  23 
October 2015. 

24. 
The  Co-Chairs  invited  the  secretariat  to  provide  delegates  with  information  on  the 
administrative  and  financial  implications  of,  and  on  the  status  of  funding  for,  additional 
sessions of the ADP in 2015. The Executive Secretary informed Parties that the secretariat 
has secured a venue for the two additional sessions of the ADP and that a total of USD 2 
million was still needed for these sessions. 

Statements  were  made  on  behalf  of  the  Presidency  of  COP  20/CMP  10  and  on 

25. 
behalf of the European Union and its 28 member States. 

IV.  Report on the eighth part of the second session 

(Agenda item 5) 

26.  At its 16th meeting, the ADP considered and adopted the draft report on the eighth 
part of its second session.21 At the same meeting, on a proposal of the Co-Chairs, the ADP 
authorized the Rapporteur to complete the report on the eighth part of the session, with the 
assistance of the secretariat and under the guidance of the Co-Chairs. 

V.  Suspension of the session 

27.  At its 16th meeting, the ADP agreed to the proposal of the Co-Chairs to suspend the 
second session and resume it in conjunction with the forty-second sessions of the subsidiary 
bodies in Bonn. 

28.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP  expressed  their  appreciation  to 
Parties for their work and support, and declared the second session of the ADP suspended.

(Agenda item 2(b)) 

The  agenda  for  the  second  session  of  the  ADP  was  adopted  by  the  ADP  at  the  1st 

8. 
meeting of the session, on 29 April 2013.5 

B.  Organization of the work of the session 

(Agenda item 2(c)) 

At the 15th meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the delegates’ attention to the scenario note 
9. 
prepared for the eighth part of the session,6 and outlined the arrangements made in the light 
of  the  organization  of  work  previously  agreed  by  the  ADP,  the  mandates  of  the  ADP, 
including those given at COP 197 and 20,8 and pre-sessional consultations. The organization 
of the work on agenda item 3 included a contact group established at the fourth part of the 
session,9 a briefing on support for domestic preparations for intended nationally determined 
contributions  (INDCs)  and  a  dedicated  meeting  on  ways  and  means  to  advance  the 
technical  examination  process  in  2015.  The  ADP  decided  to  proceed  on  the  basis  of  the 
organization of work proposed by the Co-Chairs. 

10.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  stressed  the  importance  of  time  management 
and of collaboration among Parties for the success of the collective work at this session.  

11. 
In  addition,  the  Co-Chairs  held  a  special  event  with  observer  organizations  during 
the session, on 12 February.10 Representatives of observer organizations welcomed the new 
ADP Co-Chairs, and expressed interest in continuing such special events in 2015. The ADP 
Co-Chairs  underscored  the  intergovernmental  nature  of  the  ADP  and  its  work,  and 
encouraged  observer  organizations  to  bring  forward  ideas  to  governments  for  further 
engaging in the process and strengthening implementation. 

III.  Implementation of all the elements of decision 1/CP.17 

(Agenda item 3) 

The  ADP  considered  this  agenda  item  at  its  15th  meeting,  as  well  as  at  its  16th 
12. 
meeting, held on 13 February. It had before it decision 1/CP.20, the report of the ADP on 
the seventh part of its second session,11 and the informal note prepared for the eighth part of 
the session.12 

13.  At  the  15th  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  recalled  that  the  COP  requested  the  ADP  to 
intensify its work with a view to making available a negotiating text for a protocol, another 
legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to

all  Parties  before  May  2015.13  The  Co-Chairs  reminded  Parties  that  this  negotiating  text 
was  to  be  derived  from  the  annex  to  decision  1/CP.20,  titled  “Lima  Call  for  Climate 
Action.” They noted that this text was to fully reflect the positions of all Parties. 

In accordance with this deadline, the Co-Chairs stressed their commitment to deliver 
14. 
and make available the negotiating text of the 2015 agreement by the closing plenary, on 13 
February. 

The Co-Chairs called upon the ADP to streamline the text’s language and eliminate 
15. 
redundancies  and  duplications,  better  present  alternatives  and  divergences,  and  clarify,  to 
the extent possible, proposals and concepts contained therein. 

16. 
In the interest of further refining the text over the course of future sessions, the Co-
Chairs  encouraged  Parties  to  consider  what  language  in  the  existing  text  might  be  most 
suitable  for  the  agreement,  and  what  might  be  more  appropriate  for  accompanying 
decisions. 

17. 
The  ADP  worked  sequentially  through  the  language  of  the  annex  to  decision 
1/CP.20 in an effort to develop the negotiating text. Each section was updated and further 
revised as requested by Parties, in an open and transparent manner.  Each revised iteration 
of the text was made available on the UNFCCC website. On 12 February, the sections were 
consolidated into a single document and made available as an advance unedited version on 
the UNFCCC website.14 

18. 
Further, in the context of its work on agenda item 3, the contact group referred to in 
paragraph  9  above  held  meetings  to  explore  broader  substantive  questions  related  to  the 
2015 agreement and ideas on how to make significant progress in the June session.15 The 
Co-Chairs informed Parties of their intention to issue a scenario note in order to facilitate 
preparations for that June session. 

19. 
In  the  context  of  work  on  pre-2020  climate  action,  including  on  how  to  further 
advance workstream 2, the contact group exchanged views on how to implement decision 
1/CP.19,  in  particular  paragraphs  3–5,  and  decision  1/CP.20,  in  particular  paragraphs  17–
20.  The  ADP  held  a  dedicated  meeting  on  how  to  advance  the  technical  examination 
process on 10 February.16  

20.  At  the  16th  meeting,  the  ADP  had  before  it  the  advance  unedited  version  of  the 
negotiating text, referred to in the last sentence of paragraph 17 above, and agreed that this 
text accurately reflects the proposals of all Parties and is the negotiating text that the ADP 
will use to start substantive negotiations at its next session. 

Following 

the  COP  mandate, 

the  Co-Chairs  requested 

to 
21. 
communicate  the  negotiating  text,  referred  to  in  paragraph  17  above,  to  Parties  in 
accordance  with  provisions  of  the  Convention  and  the  draft  rules  of  procedure  being 
applied, while noting that such communication will not prejudice whether the outcome will 
be  a  protocol,  another  legal  instrument  or  an  agreed  outcome  with  legal  force  under  the 
Convention applicable to all Parties.17

22.  Also  at  the  16th  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  provided  information  on  the  briefing  on 
support  for  domestic  preparations  for  INDCs  facilitated  by  Mr.  Roberto  Dondisch 
Glowinski  (Mexico).18  In  the  light  of  the  invitation  to  all  Parties  to  communicate  their

INDCs well in advance of COP 21 (by the first quarter of 2015 by those Parties ready to do 
so),19 the objective of the briefing, which took place on 9 February, was to update Parties on 
progress  in  delivering  existing  support  and  to  inform  Parties  of  other,  new  sources  of 
support for the preparation of INDCs. 

23.  At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs recalled that the ADP agreed to hold at least one 
additional session in the second half of 2015.20 The Co-Chairs requested the secretariat to 
make the necessary arrangements to organize two additional five-day sessions in the second 
half  of  the  year  in  Bonn,  Germany,  from  31  August  to  4  September  and  from  19  to  23 
October 2015. 

24. 
The  Co-Chairs  invited  the  secretariat  to  provide  delegates  with  information  on  the 
administrative  and  financial  implications  of,  and  on  the  status  of  funding  for,  additional 
sessions of the ADP in 2015. The Executive Secretary informed Parties that the secretariat 
has secured a venue for the two additional sessions of the ADP and that a total of USD 2 
million was still needed for these sessions. 

Statements  were  made  on  behalf  of  the  Presidency  of  COP  20/CMP  10  and  on 

25. 
behalf of the European Union and its 28 member States. 

IV.  Report on the eighth part of the second session 

(Agenda item 5) 

26.  At its 16th meeting, the ADP considered and adopted the draft report on the eighth 
part of its second session.21 At the same meeting, on a proposal of the Co-Chairs, the ADP 
authorized the Rapporteur to complete the report on the eighth part of the session, with the 
assistance of the secretariat and under the guidance of the Co-Chairs. 

V.  Suspension of the session 

27.  At its 16th meeting, the ADP agreed to the proposal of the Co-Chairs to suspend the 
second session and resume it in conjunction with the forty-second sessions of the subsidiary 
bodies in Bonn. 

28.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP  expressed  their  appreciation  to 
Parties for their work and support, and declared the second session of the ADP suspended.

was  to  be  derived  from  the  annex  to  decision  1/CP.20,  titled  “Lima  Call  for  Climate 
Action.” They noted that this text was to fully reflect the positions of all Parties. 

In accordance with this deadline, the Co-Chairs stressed their commitment to deliver 
14. 
and make available the negotiating text of the 2015 agreement by the closing plenary, on 13 
February. 

The Co-Chairs called upon the ADP to streamline the text’s language and eliminate 
15. 
redundancies  and  duplications,  better  present  alternatives  and  divergences,  and  clarify,  to 
the extent possible, proposals and concepts contained therein. 

16. 
In the interest of further refining the text over the course of future sessions, the Co-
Chairs  encouraged  Parties  to  consider  what  language  in  the  existing  text  might  be  most 
suitable  for  the  agreement,  and  what  might  be  more  appropriate  for  accompanying 
decisions. 

17. 
The  ADP  worked  sequentially  through  the  language  of  the  annex  to  decision 
1/CP.20 in an effort to develop the negotiating text. Each section was updated and further 
revised as requested by Parties, in an open and transparent manner.  Each revised iteration 
of the text was made available on the UNFCCC website. On 12 February, the sections were 
consolidated into a single document and made available as an advance unedited version on 
the UNFCCC website.14 

18. 
Further, in the context of its work on agenda item 3, the contact group referred to in 
paragraph  9  above  held  meetings  to  explore  broader  substantive  questions  related  to  the 
2015 agreement and ideas on how to make significant progress in the June session.15 The 
Co-Chairs informed Parties of their intention to issue a scenario note in order to facilitate 
preparations for that June session. 

19. 
In  the  context  of  work  on  pre-2020  climate  action,  including  on  how  to  further 
advance workstream 2, the contact group exchanged views on how to implement decision 
1/CP.19,  in  particular  paragraphs  3–5,  and  decision  1/CP.20,  in  particular  paragraphs  17–
20.  The  ADP  held  a  dedicated  meeting  on  how  to  advance  the  technical  examination 
process on 10 February.16  

20.  At  the  16th  meeting,  the  ADP  had  before  it  the  advance  unedited  version  of  the 
negotiating text, referred to in the last sentence of paragraph 17 above, and agreed that this 
text accurately reflects the proposals of all Parties and is the negotiating text that the ADP 
will use to start substantive negotiations at its next session. 

Following 

the  COP  mandate, 

the  Co-Chairs  requested 

to 
21. 
communicate  the  negotiating  text,  referred  to  in  paragraph  17  above,  to  Parties  in 
accordance  with  provisions  of  the  Convention  and  the  draft  rules  of  procedure  being 
applied, while noting that such communication will not prejudice whether the outcome will 
be  a  protocol,  another  legal  instrument  or  an  agreed  outcome  with  legal  force  under  the 
Convention applicable to all Parties.17

progress  in  delivering  existing  support  and  to  inform  Parties  of  other,  new  sources  of 
support for the preparation of INDCs. 

23.  At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs recalled that the ADP agreed to hold at least one 
additional session in the second half of 2015.20 The Co-Chairs requested the secretariat to 
make the necessary arrangements to organize two additional five-day sessions in the second 
half  of  the  year  in  Bonn,  Germany,  from  31  August  to  4  September  and  from  19  to  23 
October 2015. 

24. 
The  Co-Chairs  invited  the  secretariat  to  provide  delegates  with  information  on  the 
administrative  and  financial  implications  of,  and  on  the  status  of  funding  for,  additional 
sessions of the ADP in 2015. The Executive Secretary informed Parties that the secretariat 
has secured a venue for the two additional sessions of the ADP and that a total of USD 2 
million was still needed for these sessions. 

Statements  were  made  on  behalf  of  the  Presidency  of  COP  20/CMP  10  and  on 

25. 
behalf of the European Union and its 28 member States.

authorized the Rapporteur to complete the report on the eighth part of the session, with the 
assistance of the secretariat and under the guidance of the Co-Chairs. 

V.  Suspension of the session

second session and resume it in conjunction with the forty-second sessions of the subsidiary 
bodies in Bonn. 

28.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP  expressed  their  appreciation  to

I.  Opening of the session 

(Agenda item 1) 

The eighth part of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban 
1. 
Platform  for  Enhanced  Action  (ADP)  was  held  at  the  Palais  des  Nations,  Geneva, 
Switzerland, from 8 to 13 February 2015.1 

The  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP,  Mr.  Ahmed  Djoghlaf  (non-Annex  I)  and  Mr.  Daniel 
2. 
Reifsnyder (Annex I), resumed the second session of the ADP  by opening its 15th plenary 
meeting on 8 February 2015. They welcomed all Parties and observers as well as Ms. Yang 
Liu (non-Annex I), Rapporteur of the ADP.2 

A  statement  was  made  by  Mr.  Manuel  Pulgar-Vidal  (Peru),  President  of  the 
3. 
twentieth  session  of  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  (COP)  and  the  tenth  session  of  the 
Conference  of  the  Parties  serving  as  the  meeting  of  the  Parties  to  the  Kyoto  Protocol 
(CMP). 

The  Co-Chairs  informed  Parties  of  the  meetings  and  consultations  they  had  held 
4. 
with negotiating groups prior to the session, and voiced confidence that the promises made 
at  the  United  Nations  Climate  Change  Conference  held  in  Lima,  Peru,  would  be 
collectively fulfilled, including by concluding an ambitious and universal agreement at the 
United Nations Climate Change Conference to be held in in Paris, France. 

5. 
In  the  interest  of  fulfilling  the  mandate  given  in  decision  1/CP.17,  the  Co-Chairs 
encouraged Parties to convert the ‘elements’ text that emerged from the  Lima Conference 
into  the  negotiating  text  that  would  furnish  the  basis  for  work  in  2015  by  Friday,  13 
February. 

6. 
Statements  were submitted by representatives of 14 Parties, including on behalf of 
the  Group of 77 and  China, the European Union and its 28  member States, the Umbrella 
Group, the Environmental Integrity Group, the African Group, the Alliance of Small Island 
States, the least developed countries, the BASIC countries (Brazil, China, India and South 
Africa),  the  Like-minded  Developing  Countries,  the  Coalition  for  Rainforest  Nations,  the 
Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America – Peoples’ Trade Treaty, the League of 
Arab  States,  the  Independent  Association  for  Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean  and  the 
Caribbean Community.3 

7. 
Parties  demonstrated  great  initiative  and  a  spirit  of  cooperation  by  opting  to  post 
their  group  statements  on  the  web  rather  than  reading  them  aloud,  thereby  allowing  the 
work on substantive issues to start immediately.4 

1  The report on the first and second parts of the second session of the ADP is contained in document 
FCCC/ADP/2013/2; the reports on the third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh parts of the second 
session are contained in documents FCCC/ADP/2013/3, FCCC/ADP/2014/1, FCCC/ADP/2014/2,

2  The Bureau of the ADP was elected in accordance with the arrangement set out in document 

FCCC/ADP/2012/2, paragraph 7, which was endorsed by decision 2/CP.18. The ADP elected the 
current members of its Bureau at the seventh part of its second session, as reflected in document 
FCCC/ADP/2014/4.

II.  Organizational matters 

(Agenda item 2) 

A.  Adoption of the agenda 

(Agenda item 2(b)) 

The  agenda  for  the  second  session  of  the  ADP  was  adopted  by  the  ADP  at  the  1st 

8. 
meeting of the session, on 29 April 2013.5 

B.  Organization of the work of the session 

(Agenda item 2(c)) 

At the 15th meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the delegates’ attention to the scenario note 
9. 
prepared for the eighth part of the session,6 and outlined the arrangements made in the light 
of  the  organization  of  work  previously  agreed  by  the  ADP,  the  mandates  of  the  ADP, 
including those given at COP 197 and 20,8 and pre-sessional consultations. The organization 
of the work on agenda item 3 included a contact group established at the fourth part of the 
session,9 a briefing on support for domestic preparations for intended nationally determined 
contributions  (INDCs)  and  a  dedicated  meeting  on  ways  and  means  to  advance  the 
technical  examination  process  in  2015.  The  ADP  decided  to  proceed  on  the  basis  of  the 
organization of work proposed by the Co-Chairs. 

10.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  stressed  the  importance  of  time  management 
and of collaboration among Parties for the success of the collective work at this session.  

11. 
In  addition,  the  Co-Chairs  held  a  special  event  with  observer  organizations  during 
the session, on 12 February.10 Representatives of observer organizations welcomed the new 
ADP Co-Chairs, and expressed interest in continuing such special events in 2015. The ADP 
Co-Chairs  underscored  the  intergovernmental  nature  of  the  ADP  and  its  work,  and 
encouraged  observer  organizations  to  bring  forward  ideas  to  governments  for  further 
engaging in the process and strengthening implementation. 

III.  Implementation of all the elements of decision 1/CP.17 

(Agenda item 3) 

The  ADP  considered  this  agenda  item  at  its  15th  meeting,  as  well  as  at  its  16th 
12. 
meeting, held on 13 February. It had before it decision 1/CP.20, the report of the ADP on 
the seventh part of its second session,11 and the informal note prepared for the eighth part of 
the session.12 

13.  At  the  15th  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  recalled  that  the  COP  requested  the  ADP  to 
intensify its work with a view to making available a negotiating text for a protocol, another 
legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to

I.  Opening of the session 

(Agenda item 1) 

The eighth part of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban 
1. 
Platform  for  Enhanced  Action  (ADP)  was  held  at  the  Palais  des  Nations,  Geneva, 
Switzerland, from 8 to 13 February 2015.1 

The  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP,  Mr.  Ahmed  Djoghlaf  (non-Annex  I)  and  Mr.  Daniel 
2. 
Reifsnyder (Annex I), resumed the second session of the ADP  by opening its 15th plenary 
meeting on 8 February 2015. They welcomed all Parties and observers as well as Ms. Yang 
Liu (non-Annex I), Rapporteur of the ADP.2 

A  statement  was  made  by  Mr.  Manuel  Pulgar-Vidal  (Peru),  President  of  the 
3. 
twentieth  session  of  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  (COP)  and  the  tenth  session  of  the 
Conference  of  the  Parties  serving  as  the  meeting  of  the  Parties  to  the  Kyoto  Protocol 
(CMP). 

The  Co-Chairs  informed  Parties  of  the  meetings  and  consultations  they  had  held 
4. 
with negotiating groups prior to the session, and voiced confidence that the promises made 
at  the  United  Nations  Climate  Change  Conference  held  in  Lima,  Peru,  would  be 
collectively fulfilled, including by concluding an ambitious and universal agreement at the 
United Nations Climate Change Conference to be held in in Paris, France. 

5. 
In  the  interest  of  fulfilling  the  mandate  given  in  decision  1/CP.17,  the  Co-Chairs 
encouraged Parties to convert the ‘elements’ text that emerged from the  Lima Conference 
into  the  negotiating  text  that  would  furnish  the  basis  for  work  in  2015  by  Friday,  13 
February. 

6. 
Statements  were submitted by representatives of 14 Parties, including on behalf of 
the  Group of 77 and  China, the European Union and its 28  member States, the Umbrella 
Group, the Environmental Integrity Group, the African Group, the Alliance of Small Island 
States, the least developed countries, the BASIC countries (Brazil, China, India and South 
Africa),  the  Like-minded  Developing  Countries,  the  Coalition  for  Rainforest  Nations,  the 
Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America – Peoples’ Trade Treaty, the League of 
Arab  States,  the  Independent  Association  for  Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean  and  the 
Caribbean Community.3 

7. 
Parties  demonstrated  great  initiative  and  a  spirit  of  cooperation  by  opting  to  post 
their  group  statements  on  the  web  rather  than  reading  them  aloud,  thereby  allowing  the 
work on substantive issues to start immediately.4 

1  The report on the first and second parts of the second session of the ADP is contained in document 
FCCC/ADP/2013/2; the reports on the third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh parts of the second 
session are contained in documents FCCC/ADP/2013/3, FCCC/ADP/2014/1, FCCC/ADP/2014/2,

2  The Bureau of the ADP was elected in accordance with the arrangement set out in document 

FCCC/ADP/2012/2, paragraph 7, which was endorsed by decision 2/CP.18. The ADP elected the 
current members of its Bureau at the seventh part of its second session, as reflected in document 
FCCC/ADP/2014/4.

II.  Organizational matters 

(Agenda item 2) 

A.  Adoption of the agenda 

(Agenda item 2(b)) 

The  agenda  for  the  second  session  of  the  ADP  was  adopted  by  the  ADP  at  the  1st 

8. 
meeting of the session, on 29 April 2013.5 

B.  Organization of the work of the session 

(Agenda item 2(c)) 

At the 15th meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the delegates’ attention to the scenario note 
9. 
prepared for the eighth part of the session,6 and outlined the arrangements made in the light 
of  the  organization  of  work  previously  agreed  by  the  ADP,  the  mandates  of  the  ADP, 
including those given at COP 197 and 20,8 and pre-sessional consultations. The organization 
of the work on agenda item 3 included a contact group established at the fourth part of the 
session,9 a briefing on support for domestic preparations for intended nationally determined 
contributions  (INDCs)  and  a  dedicated  meeting  on  ways  and  means  to  advance  the 
technical  examination  process  in  2015.  The  ADP  decided  to  proceed  on  the  basis  of  the 
organization of work proposed by the Co-Chairs. 

10.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  stressed  the  importance  of  time  management 
and of collaboration among Parties for the success of the collective work at this session.  

11. 
In  addition,  the  Co-Chairs  held  a  special  event  with  observer  organizations  during 
the session, on 12 February.10 Representatives of observer organizations welcomed the new 
ADP Co-Chairs, and expressed interest in continuing such special events in 2015. The ADP 
Co-Chairs  underscored  the  intergovernmental  nature  of  the  ADP  and  its  work,  and 
encouraged  observer  organizations  to  bring  forward  ideas  to  governments  for  further 
engaging in the process and strengthening implementation. 

III.  Implementation of all the elements of decision 1/CP.17 

(Agenda item 3) 

The  ADP  considered  this  agenda  item  at  its  15th  meeting,  as  well  as  at  its  16th 
12. 
meeting, held on 13 February. It had before it decision 1/CP.20, the report of the ADP on 
the seventh part of its second session,11 and the informal note prepared for the eighth part of 
the session.12 

13.  At  the  15th  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  recalled  that  the  COP  requested  the  ADP  to 
intensify its work with a view to making available a negotiating text for a protocol, another 
legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to 

5  FCCC/ADP/2013/2, paragraphs 8 and 9.

FCCC/ADP/2015/2 

all  Parties  before  May  2015.13  The  Co-Chairs  reminded  Parties  that  this  negotiating  text 
was  to  be  derived  from  the  annex  to  decision  1/CP.20,  titled  “Lima  Call  for  Climate 
Action.” They noted that this text was to fully reflect the positions of all Parties. 

In accordance with this deadline, the Co-Chairs stressed their commitment to deliver 
14. 
and make available the negotiating text of the 2015 agreement by the closing plenary, on 13 
February. 

The Co-Chairs called upon the ADP to streamline the text’s language and eliminate 
15. 
redundancies  and  duplications,  better  present  alternatives  and  divergences,  and  clarify,  to 
the extent possible, proposals and concepts contained therein. 

16. 
In the interest of further refining the text over the course of future sessions, the Co-
Chairs  encouraged  Parties  to  consider  what  language  in  the  existing  text  might  be  most 
suitable  for  the  agreement,  and  what  might  be  more  appropriate  for  accompanying 
decisions. 

17. 
The  ADP  worked  sequentially  through  the  language  of  the  annex  to  decision 
1/CP.20 in an effort to develop the negotiating text. Each section was updated and further 
revised as requested by Parties, in an open and transparent manner.  Each revised iteration 
of the text was made available on the UNFCCC website. On 12 February, the sections were 
consolidated into a single document and made available as an advance unedited version on 
the UNFCCC website.14 

18. 
Further, in the context of its work on agenda item 3, the contact group referred to in 
paragraph  9  above  held  meetings  to  explore  broader  substantive  questions  related  to  the 
2015 agreement and ideas on how to make significant progress in the June session.15 The 
Co-Chairs informed Parties of their intention to issue a scenario note in order to facilitate 
preparations for that June session. 

19. 
In  the  context  of  work  on  pre-2020  climate  action,  including  on  how  to  further 
advance workstream 2, the contact group exchanged views on how to implement decision 
1/CP.19,  in  particular  paragraphs  3–5,  and  decision  1/CP.20,  in  particular  paragraphs  17–
20.  The  ADP  held  a  dedicated  meeting  on  how  to  advance  the  technical  examination 
process on 10 February.16  

20.  At  the  16th  meeting,  the  ADP  had  before  it  the  advance  unedited  version  of  the 
negotiating text, referred to in the last sentence of paragraph 17 above, and agreed that this 
text accurately reflects the proposals of all Parties and is the negotiating text that the ADP 
will use to start substantive negotiations at its next session. 

Following 

the  COP  mandate, 

the  Co-Chairs  requested 

to 
21. 
communicate  the  negotiating  text,  referred  to  in  paragraph  17  above,  to  Parties  in 
accordance  with  provisions  of  the  Convention  and  the  draft  rules  of  procedure  being 
applied, while noting that such communication will not prejudice whether the outcome will 
be  a  protocol,  another  legal  instrument  or  an  agreed  outcome  with  legal  force  under  the 
Convention applicable to all Parties.17

22.  Also  at  the  16th  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  provided  information  on  the  briefing  on 
support  for  domestic  preparations  for  INDCs  facilitated  by  Mr.  Roberto  Dondisch 
Glowinski  (Mexico).18  In  the  light  of  the  invitation  to  all  Parties  to  communicate  their

INDCs well in advance of COP 21 (by the first quarter of 2015 by those Parties ready to do 
so),19 the objective of the briefing, which took place on 9 February, was to update Parties on 
progress  in  delivering  existing  support  and  to  inform  Parties  of  other,  new  sources  of 
support for the preparation of INDCs. 

23.  At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs recalled that the ADP agreed to hold at least one 
additional session in the second half of 2015.20 The Co-Chairs requested the secretariat to 
make the necessary arrangements to organize two additional five-day sessions in the second 
half  of  the  year  in  Bonn,  Germany,  from  31  August  to  4  September  and  from  19  to  23 
October 2015. 

24. 
The  Co-Chairs  invited  the  secretariat  to  provide  delegates  with  information  on  the 
administrative  and  financial  implications  of,  and  on  the  status  of  funding  for,  additional 
sessions of the ADP in 2015. The Executive Secretary informed Parties that the secretariat 
has secured a venue for the two additional sessions of the ADP and that a total of USD 2 
million was still needed for these sessions. 

Statements  were  made  on  behalf  of  the  Presidency  of  COP  20/CMP  10  and  on 

25. 
behalf of the European Union and its 28 member States. 

IV.  Report on the eighth part of the second session 

(Agenda item 5) 

26.  At its 16th meeting, the ADP considered and adopted the draft report on the eighth 
part of its second session.21 At the same meeting, on a proposal of the Co-Chairs, the ADP 
authorized the Rapporteur to complete the report on the eighth part of the session, with the 
assistance of the secretariat and under the guidance of the Co-Chairs. 

V.  Suspension of the session 

27.  At its 16th meeting, the ADP agreed to the proposal of the Co-Chairs to suspend the 
second session and resume it in conjunction with the forty-second sessions of the subsidiary 
bodies in Bonn. 

28.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP  expressed  their  appreciation  to 
Parties for their work and support, and declared the second session of the ADP suspended.

(Agenda item 2) 

A.  Adoption of the agenda 

(Agenda item 2(b)) 

The  agenda  for  the  second  session  of  the  ADP  was  adopted  by  the  ADP  at  the  1st 

8. 
meeting of the session, on 29 April 2013.5 

B.  Organization of the work of the session 

(Agenda item 2(c)) 

At the 15th meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the delegates’ attention to the scenario note 
9. 
prepared for the eighth part of the session,6 and outlined the arrangements made in the light 
of  the  organization  of  work  previously  agreed  by  the  ADP,  the  mandates  of  the  ADP, 
including those given at COP 197 and 20,8 and pre-sessional consultations. The organization 
of the work on agenda item 3 included a contact group established at the fourth part of the 
session,9 a briefing on support for domestic preparations for intended nationally determined 
contributions  (INDCs)  and  a  dedicated  meeting  on  ways  and  means  to  advance  the 
technical  examination  process  in  2015.  The  ADP  decided  to  proceed  on  the  basis  of  the 
organization of work proposed by the Co-Chairs. 

10.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  stressed  the  importance  of  time  management 
and of collaboration among Parties for the success of the collective work at this session.  

11. 
In  addition,  the  Co-Chairs  held  a  special  event  with  observer  organizations  during 
the session, on 12 February.10 Representatives of observer organizations welcomed the new 
ADP Co-Chairs, and expressed interest in continuing such special events in 2015. The ADP 
Co-Chairs  underscored  the  intergovernmental  nature  of  the  ADP  and  its  work,  and 
encouraged  observer  organizations  to  bring  forward  ideas  to  governments  for  further 
engaging in the process and strengthening implementation. 

III.  Implementation of all the elements of decision 1/CP.17 

(Agenda item 3) 

The  ADP  considered  this  agenda  item  at  its  15th  meeting,  as  well  as  at  its  16th 
12. 
meeting, held on 13 February. It had before it decision 1/CP.20, the report of the ADP on 
the seventh part of its second session,11 and the informal note prepared for the eighth part of 
the session.12 

13.  At  the  15th  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  recalled  that  the  COP  requested  the  ADP  to 
intensify its work with a view to making available a negotiating text for a protocol, another 
legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to

all  Parties  before  May  2015.13  The  Co-Chairs  reminded  Parties  that  this  negotiating  text 
was  to  be  derived  from  the  annex  to  decision  1/CP.20,  titled  “Lima  Call  for  Climate 
Action.” They noted that this text was to fully reflect the positions of all Parties. 

In accordance with this deadline, the Co-Chairs stressed their commitment to deliver 
14. 
and make available the negotiating text of the 2015 agreement by the closing plenary, on 13 
February. 

The Co-Chairs called upon the ADP to streamline the text’s language and eliminate 
15. 
redundancies  and  duplications,  better  present  alternatives  and  divergences,  and  clarify,  to 
the extent possible, proposals and concepts contained therein. 

16. 
In the interest of further refining the text over the course of future sessions, the Co-
Chairs  encouraged  Parties  to  consider  what  language  in  the  existing  text  might  be  most 
suitable  for  the  agreement,  and  what  might  be  more  appropriate  for  accompanying 
decisions. 

17. 
The  ADP  worked  sequentially  through  the  language  of  the  annex  to  decision 
1/CP.20 in an effort to develop the negotiating text. Each section was updated and further 
revised as requested by Parties, in an open and transparent manner.  Each revised iteration 
of the text was made available on the UNFCCC website. On 12 February, the sections were 
consolidated into a single document and made available as an advance unedited version on 
the UNFCCC website.14 

18. 
Further, in the context of its work on agenda item 3, the contact group referred to in 
paragraph  9  above  held  meetings  to  explore  broader  substantive  questions  related  to  the 
2015 agreement and ideas on how to make significant progress in the June session.15 The 
Co-Chairs informed Parties of their intention to issue a scenario note in order to facilitate 
preparations for that June session. 

19. 
In  the  context  of  work  on  pre-2020  climate  action,  including  on  how  to  further 
advance workstream 2, the contact group exchanged views on how to implement decision 
1/CP.19,  in  particular  paragraphs  3–5,  and  decision  1/CP.20,  in  particular  paragraphs  17–
20.  The  ADP  held  a  dedicated  meeting  on  how  to  advance  the  technical  examination 
process on 10 February.16  

20.  At  the  16th  meeting,  the  ADP  had  before  it  the  advance  unedited  version  of  the 
negotiating text, referred to in the last sentence of paragraph 17 above, and agreed that this 
text accurately reflects the proposals of all Parties and is the negotiating text that the ADP 
will use to start substantive negotiations at its next session. 

Following 

the  COP  mandate, 

the  Co-Chairs  requested 

to 
21. 
communicate  the  negotiating  text,  referred  to  in  paragraph  17  above,  to  Parties  in 
accordance  with  provisions  of  the  Convention  and  the  draft  rules  of  procedure  being 
applied, while noting that such communication will not prejudice whether the outcome will 
be  a  protocol,  another  legal  instrument  or  an  agreed  outcome  with  legal  force  under  the 
Convention applicable to all Parties.17

22.  Also  at  the  16th  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  provided  information  on  the  briefing  on 
support  for  domestic  preparations  for  INDCs  facilitated  by  Mr.  Roberto  Dondisch 
Glowinski  (Mexico).18  In  the  light  of  the  invitation  to  all  Parties  to  communicate  their

INDCs well in advance of COP 21 (by the first quarter of 2015 by those Parties ready to do 
so),19 the objective of the briefing, which took place on 9 February, was to update Parties on 
progress  in  delivering  existing  support  and  to  inform  Parties  of  other,  new  sources  of 
support for the preparation of INDCs. 

23.  At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs recalled that the ADP agreed to hold at least one 
additional session in the second half of 2015.20 The Co-Chairs requested the secretariat to 
make the necessary arrangements to organize two additional five-day sessions in the second 
half  of  the  year  in  Bonn,  Germany,  from  31  August  to  4  September  and  from  19  to  23 
October 2015. 

24. 
The  Co-Chairs  invited  the  secretariat  to  provide  delegates  with  information  on  the 
administrative  and  financial  implications  of,  and  on  the  status  of  funding  for,  additional 
sessions of the ADP in 2015. The Executive Secretary informed Parties that the secretariat 
has secured a venue for the two additional sessions of the ADP and that a total of USD 2 
million was still needed for these sessions. 

Statements  were  made  on  behalf  of  the  Presidency  of  COP  20/CMP  10  and  on 

25. 
behalf of the European Union and its 28 member States. 

IV.  Report on the eighth part of the second session 

(Agenda item 5) 

26.  At its 16th meeting, the ADP considered and adopted the draft report on the eighth 
part of its second session.21 At the same meeting, on a proposal of the Co-Chairs, the ADP 
authorized the Rapporteur to complete the report on the eighth part of the session, with the 
assistance of the secretariat and under the guidance of the Co-Chairs. 

V.  Suspension of the session 

27.  At its 16th meeting, the ADP agreed to the proposal of the Co-Chairs to suspend the 
second session and resume it in conjunction with the forty-second sessions of the subsidiary 
bodies in Bonn. 

28.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP  expressed  their  appreciation  to 
Parties for their work and support, and declared the second session of the ADP suspended.

(CMP). 

The  Co-Chairs  informed  Parties  of  the  meetings  and  consultations  they  had  held 
4. 
with negotiating groups prior to the session, and voiced confidence that the promises made 
at  the  United  Nations  Climate  Change  Conference  held  in  Lima,  Peru,  would  be 
collectively fulfilled, including by concluding an ambitious and universal agreement at the 
United Nations Climate Change Conference to be held in in Paris, France. 

5. 
In  the  interest  of  fulfilling  the  mandate  given  in  decision  1/CP.17,  the  Co-Chairs 
encouraged Parties to convert the ‘elements’ text that emerged from the  Lima Conference 
into  the  negotiating  text  that  would  furnish  the  basis  for  work  in  2015  by  Friday,  13 
February. 

6.

administrative  and  financial  implications  of,  and  on  the  status  of  funding  for,  additional 
sessions of the ADP in 2015. The Executive Secretary informed Parties that the secretariat

I.  Opening of the session 

(Agenda item 1) 

The eighth part of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban 
1. 
Platform  for  Enhanced  Action  (ADP)  was  held  at  the  Palais  des  Nations,  Geneva, 
Switzerland, from 8 to 13 February 2015.1 

The  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP,  Mr.  Ahmed  Djoghlaf  (non-Annex  I)  and  Mr.  Daniel 
2. 
Reifsnyder (Annex I), resumed the second session of the ADP  by opening its 15th plenary 
meeting on 8 February 2015. They welcomed all Parties and observers as well as Ms. Yang 
Liu (non-Annex I), Rapporteur of the ADP.2 

A  statement  was  made  by  Mr.  Manuel  Pulgar-Vidal  (Peru),  President  of  the 
3. 
twentieth  session  of  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  (COP)  and  the  tenth  session  of  the 
Conference  of  the  Parties  serving  as  the  meeting  of  the  Parties  to  the  Kyoto  Protocol 
(CMP). 

The  Co-Chairs  informed  Parties  of  the  meetings  and  consultations  they  had  held 
4. 
with negotiating groups prior to the session, and voiced confidence that the promises made 
at  the  United  Nations  Climate  Change  Conference  held  in  Lima,  Peru,  would  be 
collectively fulfilled, including by concluding an ambitious and universal agreement at the 
United Nations Climate Change Conference to be held in in Paris, France. 

5. 
In  the  interest  of  fulfilling  the  mandate  given  in  decision  1/CP.17,  the  Co-Chairs 
encouraged Parties to convert the ‘elements’ text that emerged from the  Lima Conference 
into  the  negotiating  text  that  would  furnish  the  basis  for  work  in  2015  by  Friday,  13 
February. 

6. 
Statements  were submitted by representatives of 14 Parties, including on behalf of 
the  Group of 77 and  China, the European Union and its 28  member States, the Umbrella 
Group, the Environmental Integrity Group, the African Group, the Alliance of Small Island 
States, the least developed countries, the BASIC countries (Brazil, China, India and South 
Africa),  the  Like-minded  Developing  Countries,  the  Coalition  for  Rainforest  Nations,  the 
Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America – Peoples’ Trade Treaty, the League of 
Arab  States,  the  Independent  Association  for  Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean  and  the 
Caribbean Community.3 

7. 
Parties  demonstrated  great  initiative  and  a  spirit  of  cooperation  by  opting  to  post 
their  group  statements  on  the  web  rather  than  reading  them  aloud,  thereby  allowing  the 
work on substantive issues to start immediately.4 

1  The report on the first and second parts of the second session of the ADP is contained in document 
FCCC/ADP/2013/2; the reports on the third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh parts of the second 
session are contained in documents FCCC/ADP/2013/3, FCCC/ADP/2014/1, FCCC/ADP/2014/2, 
FCCC/ADP/2014/3 and FCCC/ADP/2014/4, respectively. 

2  The Bureau of the ADP was elected in accordance with the arrangement set out in document 

FCCC/ADP/2012/2, paragraph 7, which was endorsed by decision 2/CP.18. The ADP elected the 
current members of its Bureau at the seventh part of its second session, as reflected in document 
FCCC/ADP/2014/4.

II.  Organizational matters 

(Agenda item 2) 

A.  Adoption of the agenda 

(Agenda item 2(b)) 

The  agenda  for  the  second  session  of  the  ADP  was  adopted  by  the  ADP  at  the  1st 

8. 
meeting of the session, on 29 April 2013.5 

B.  Organization of the work of the session 

(Agenda item 2(c)) 

At the 15th meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the delegates’ attention to the scenario note 
9. 
prepared for the eighth part of the session,6 and outlined the arrangements made in the light 
of  the  organization  of  work  previously  agreed  by  the  ADP,  the  mandates  of  the  ADP, 
including those given at COP 197 and 20,8 and pre-sessional consultations. The organization 
of the work on agenda item 3 included a contact group established at the fourth part of the 
session,9 a briefing on support for domestic preparations for intended nationally determined 
contributions  (INDCs)  and  a  dedicated  meeting  on  ways  and  means  to  advance  the 
technical  examination  process  in  2015.  The  ADP  decided  to  proceed  on  the  basis  of  the 
organization of work proposed by the Co-Chairs. 

10.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  stressed  the  importance  of  time  management 
and of collaboration among Parties for the success of the collective work at this session.  

11. 
In  addition,  the  Co-Chairs  held  a  special  event  with  observer  organizations  during 
the session, on 12 February.10 Representatives of observer organizations welcomed the new 
ADP Co-Chairs, and expressed interest in continuing such special events in 2015. The ADP 
Co-Chairs  underscored  the  intergovernmental  nature  of  the  ADP  and  its  work,  and 
encouraged  observer  organizations  to  bring  forward  ideas  to  governments  for  further 
engaging in the process and strengthening implementation. 

III.  Implementation of all the elements of decision 1/CP.17 

(Agenda item 3) 

The  ADP  considered  this  agenda  item  at  its  15th  meeting,  as  well  as  at  its  16th 
12. 
meeting, held on 13 February. It had before it decision 1/CP.20, the report of the ADP on 
the seventh part of its second session,11 and the informal note prepared for the eighth part of 
the session.12 

13.  At  the  15th  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  recalled  that  the  COP  requested  the  ADP  to 
intensify its work with a view to making available a negotiating text for a protocol, another 
legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to 

5  FCCC/ADP/2013/2, paragraphs 8 and 9.

FCCC/ADP/2015/2 

all  Parties  before  May  2015.13  The  Co-Chairs  reminded  Parties  that  this  negotiating  text 
was  to  be  derived  from  the  annex  to  decision  1/CP.20,  titled  “Lima  Call  for  Climate 
Action.” They noted that this text was to fully reflect the positions of all Parties. 

In accordance with this deadline, the Co-Chairs stressed their commitment to deliver 
14. 
and make available the negotiating text of the 2015 agreement by the closing plenary, on 13 
February. 

The Co-Chairs called upon the ADP to streamline the text’s language and eliminate 
15. 
redundancies  and  duplications,  better  present  alternatives  and  divergences,  and  clarify,  to 
the extent possible, proposals and concepts contained therein. 

16. 
In the interest of further refining the text over the course of future sessions, the Co-
Chairs  encouraged  Parties  to  consider  what  language  in  the  existing  text  might  be  most 
suitable  for  the  agreement,  and  what  might  be  more  appropriate  for  accompanying 
decisions. 

17. 
The  ADP  worked  sequentially  through  the  language  of  the  annex  to  decision 
1/CP.20 in an effort to develop the negotiating text. Each section was updated and further 
revised as requested by Parties, in an open and transparent manner.  Each revised iteration 
of the text was made available on the UNFCCC website. On 12 February, the sections were 
consolidated into a single document and made available as an advance unedited version on 
the UNFCCC website.14 

18. 
Further, in the context of its work on agenda item 3, the contact group referred to in 
paragraph  9  above  held  meetings  to  explore  broader  substantive  questions  related  to  the 
2015 agreement and ideas on how to make significant progress in the June session.15 The 
Co-Chairs informed Parties of their intention to issue a scenario note in order to facilitate 
preparations for that June session. 

19. 
In  the  context  of  work  on  pre-2020  climate  action,  including  on  how  to  further 
advance workstream 2, the contact group exchanged views on how to implement decision 
1/CP.19,  in  particular  paragraphs  3–5,  and  decision  1/CP.20,  in  particular  paragraphs  17–
20.  The  ADP  held  a  dedicated  meeting  on  how  to  advance  the  technical  examination 
process on 10 February.16  

20.  At  the  16th  meeting,  the  ADP  had  before  it  the  advance  unedited  version  of  the 
negotiating text, referred to in the last sentence of paragraph 17 above, and agreed that this 
text accurately reflects the proposals of all Parties and is the negotiating text that the ADP 
will use to start substantive negotiations at its next session. 

Following 

the  COP  mandate, 

the  Co-Chairs  requested 

to 
21. 
communicate  the  negotiating  text,  referred  to  in  paragraph  17  above,  to  Parties  in 
accordance  with  provisions  of  the  Convention  and  the  draft  rules  of  procedure  being 
applied, while noting that such communication will not prejudice whether the outcome will 
be  a  protocol,  another  legal  instrument  or  an  agreed  outcome  with  legal  force  under  the

I.  Opening of the session 

(Agenda item 1) 

The eighth part of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban 
1. 
Platform  for  Enhanced  Action  (ADP)  was  held  at  the  Palais  des  Nations,  Geneva, 
Switzerland, from 8 to 13 February 2015.1 

The  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP,  Mr.  Ahmed  Djoghlaf  (non-Annex  I)  and  Mr.  Daniel 
2. 
Reifsnyder (Annex I), resumed the second session of the ADP  by opening its 15th plenary 
meeting on 8 February 2015. They welcomed all Parties and observers as well as Ms. Yang 
Liu (non-Annex I), Rapporteur of the ADP.2 

A  statement  was  made  by  Mr.  Manuel  Pulgar-Vidal  (Peru),  President  of  the 
3. 
twentieth  session  of  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  (COP)  and  the  tenth  session  of  the 
Conference  of  the  Parties  serving  as  the  meeting  of  the  Parties  to  the  Kyoto  Protocol 
(CMP). 

The  Co-Chairs  informed  Parties  of  the  meetings  and  consultations  they  had  held 
4. 
with negotiating groups prior to the session, and voiced confidence that the promises made 
at  the  United  Nations  Climate  Change  Conference  held  in  Lima,  Peru,  would  be 
collectively fulfilled, including by concluding an ambitious and universal agreement at the 
United Nations Climate Change Conference to be held in in Paris, France. 

5. 
In  the  interest  of  fulfilling  the  mandate  given  in  decision  1/CP.17,  the  Co-Chairs 
encouraged Parties to convert the ‘elements’ text that emerged from the  Lima Conference 
into  the  negotiating  text  that  would  furnish  the  basis  for  work  in  2015  by  Friday,  13 
February. 

6. 
Statements  were submitted by representatives of 14 Parties, including on behalf of 
the  Group of 77 and  China, the European Union and its 28  member States, the Umbrella 
Group, the Environmental Integrity Group, the African Group, the Alliance of Small Island 
States, the least developed countries, the BASIC countries (Brazil, China, India and South 
Africa),  the  Like-minded  Developing  Countries,  the  Coalition  for  Rainforest  Nations,  the 
Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America – Peoples’ Trade Treaty, the League of 
Arab  States,  the  Independent  Association  for  Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean  and  the 
Caribbean Community.3 

7. 
Parties  demonstrated  great  initiative  and  a  spirit  of  cooperation  by  opting  to  post 
their  group  statements  on  the  web  rather  than  reading  them  aloud,  thereby  allowing  the 
work on substantive issues to start immediately.4 

1  The report on the first and second parts of the second session of the ADP is contained in document 
FCCC/ADP/2013/2; the reports on the third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh parts of the second 
session are contained in documents FCCC/ADP/2013/3, FCCC/ADP/2014/1, FCCC/ADP/2014/2,

II.  Organizational matters 

(Agenda item 2) 

A.  Adoption of the agenda 

(Agenda item 2(b)) 

The  agenda  for  the  second  session  of  the  ADP  was  adopted  by  the  ADP  at  the  1st 

8. 
meeting of the session, on 29 April 2013.5 

B.  Organization of the work of the session 

(Agenda item 2(c)) 

At the 15th meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the delegates’ attention to the scenario note 
9. 
prepared for the eighth part of the session,6 and outlined the arrangements made in the light 
of  the  organization  of  work  previously  agreed  by  the  ADP,  the  mandates  of  the  ADP, 
including those given at COP 197 and 20,8 and pre-sessional consultations. The organization 
of the work on agenda item 3 included a contact group established at the fourth part of the 
session,9 a briefing on support for domestic preparations for intended nationally determined 
contributions  (INDCs)  and  a  dedicated  meeting  on  ways  and  means  to  advance  the 
technical  examination  process  in  2015.  The  ADP  decided  to  proceed  on  the  basis  of  the 
organization of work proposed by the Co-Chairs. 

10.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  stressed  the  importance  of  time  management 
and of collaboration among Parties for the success of the collective work at this session.  

11. 
In  addition,  the  Co-Chairs  held  a  special  event  with  observer  organizations  during 
the session, on 12 February.10 Representatives of observer organizations welcomed the new 
ADP Co-Chairs, and expressed interest in continuing such special events in 2015. The ADP 
Co-Chairs  underscored  the  intergovernmental  nature  of  the  ADP  and  its  work,  and 
encouraged  observer  organizations  to  bring  forward  ideas  to  governments  for  further 
engaging in the process and strengthening implementation. 

III.  Implementation of all the elements of decision 1/CP.17 

(Agenda item 3) 

The  ADP  considered  this  agenda  item  at  its  15th  meeting,  as  well  as  at  its  16th 
12. 
meeting, held on 13 February. It had before it decision 1/CP.20, the report of the ADP on 
the seventh part of its second session,11 and the informal note prepared for the eighth part of 
the session.12 

13.  At  the  15th  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  recalled  that  the  COP  requested  the  ADP  to 
intensify its work with a view to making available a negotiating text for a protocol, another 
legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to 

5  FCCC/ADP/2013/2, paragraphs 8 and 9.

FCCC/ADP/2015/2 

all  Parties  before  May  2015.13  The  Co-Chairs  reminded  Parties  that  this  negotiating  text 
was  to  be  derived  from  the  annex  to  decision  1/CP.20,  titled  “Lima  Call  for  Climate 
Action.” They noted that this text was to fully reflect the positions of all Parties. 

In accordance with this deadline, the Co-Chairs stressed their commitment to deliver 
14. 
and make available the negotiating text of the 2015 agreement by the closing plenary, on 13 
February. 

The Co-Chairs called upon the ADP to streamline the text’s language and eliminate 
15. 
redundancies  and  duplications,  better  present  alternatives  and  divergences,  and  clarify,  to 
the extent possible, proposals and concepts contained therein. 

16. 
In the interest of further refining the text over the course of future sessions, the Co-
Chairs  encouraged  Parties  to  consider  what  language  in  the  existing  text  might  be  most 
suitable  for  the  agreement,  and  what  might  be  more  appropriate  for  accompanying 
decisions. 

17. 
The  ADP  worked  sequentially  through  the  language  of  the  annex  to  decision 
1/CP.20 in an effort to develop the negotiating text. Each section was updated and further 
revised as requested by Parties, in an open and transparent manner.  Each revised iteration 
of the text was made available on the UNFCCC website. On 12 February, the sections were 
consolidated into a single document and made available as an advance unedited version on 
the UNFCCC website.14 

18. 
Further, in the context of its work on agenda item 3, the contact group referred to in 
paragraph  9  above  held  meetings  to  explore  broader  substantive  questions  related  to  the 
2015 agreement and ideas on how to make significant progress in the June session.15 The 
Co-Chairs informed Parties of their intention to issue a scenario note in order to facilitate 
preparations for that June session. 

19. 
In  the  context  of  work  on  pre-2020  climate  action,  including  on  how  to  further 
advance workstream 2, the contact group exchanged views on how to implement decision 
1/CP.19,  in  particular  paragraphs  3–5,  and  decision  1/CP.20,  in  particular  paragraphs  17–
20.  The  ADP  held  a  dedicated  meeting  on  how  to  advance  the  technical  examination 
process on 10 February.16  

20.  At  the  16th  meeting,  the  ADP  had  before  it  the  advance  unedited  version  of  the 
negotiating text, referred to in the last sentence of paragraph 17 above, and agreed that this 
text accurately reflects the proposals of all Parties and is the negotiating text that the ADP 
will use to start substantive negotiations at its next session. 

Following 

the  COP  mandate, 

the  Co-Chairs  requested 

to 
21. 
communicate  the  negotiating  text,  referred  to  in  paragraph  17  above,  to  Parties  in 
accordance  with  provisions  of  the  Convention  and  the  draft  rules  of  procedure  being 
applied, while noting that such communication will not prejudice whether the outcome will 
be  a  protocol,  another  legal  instrument  or  an  agreed  outcome  with  legal  force  under  the 
Convention applicable to all Parties.17

22.  Also  at  the  16th  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  provided  information  on  the  briefing  on 
support  for  domestic  preparations  for  INDCs  facilitated  by  Mr.  Roberto  Dondisch 
Glowinski  (Mexico).18  In  the  light  of  the  invitation  to  all  Parties  to  communicate  their

INDCs well in advance of COP 21 (by the first quarter of 2015 by those Parties ready to do 
so),19 the objective of the briefing, which took place on 9 February, was to update Parties on 
progress  in  delivering  existing  support  and  to  inform  Parties  of  other,  new  sources  of 
support for the preparation of INDCs. 

23.  At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs recalled that the ADP agreed to hold at least one 
additional session in the second half of 2015.20 The Co-Chairs requested the secretariat to 
make the necessary arrangements to organize two additional five-day sessions in the second 
half  of  the  year  in  Bonn,  Germany,  from  31  August  to  4  September  and  from  19  to  23 
October 2015. 

24. 
The  Co-Chairs  invited  the  secretariat  to  provide  delegates  with  information  on  the 
administrative  and  financial  implications  of,  and  on  the  status  of  funding  for,  additional 
sessions of the ADP in 2015. The Executive Secretary informed Parties that the secretariat 
has secured a venue for the two additional sessions of the ADP and that a total of USD 2 
million was still needed for these sessions. 

Statements  were  made  on  behalf  of  the  Presidency  of  COP  20/CMP  10  and  on 

25. 
behalf of the European Union and its 28 member States. 

IV.  Report on the eighth part of the second session 

(Agenda item 5) 

26.  At its 16th meeting, the ADP considered and adopted the draft report on the eighth 
part of its second session.21 At the same meeting, on a proposal of the Co-Chairs, the ADP 
authorized the Rapporteur to complete the report on the eighth part of the session, with the 
assistance of the secretariat and under the guidance of the Co-Chairs. 

V.  Suspension of the session 

27.  At its 16th meeting, the ADP agreed to the proposal of the Co-Chairs to suspend the 
second session and resume it in conjunction with the forty-second sessions of the subsidiary 
bodies in Bonn. 

28.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP  expressed  their  appreciation  to 
Parties for their work and support, and declared the second session of the ADP suspended.

(Agenda item 2(c)) 

At the 15th meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the delegates’ attention to the scenario note

of  the  organization  of  work  previously  agreed  by  the  ADP,  the  mandates  of  the  ADP,

contributions  (INDCs)  and  a  dedicated  meeting  on  ways  and  means  to  advance  the

organization of work proposed by the Co-Chairs. 

10.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  stressed  the  importance  of  time  management 
and of collaboration among Parties for the success of the collective work at this session.  

11. 
In  addition,  the  Co-Chairs  held  a  special  event  with  observer  organizations  during 
the session, on 12 February.10 Representatives of observer organizations welcomed the new 
ADP Co-Chairs, and expressed interest in continuing such special events in 2015. The ADP 
Co-Chairs  underscored  the  intergovernmental  nature  of  the  ADP  and  its  work,  and 
encouraged  observer  organizations  to  bring  forward  ideas  to  governments  for  further 
engaging in the process and strengthening implementation. 

III.  Implementation of all the elements of decision 1/CP.17 

(Agenda item 3) 

The  ADP  considered  this  agenda  item  at  its  15th  meeting,  as  well  as  at  its  16th 
12. 
meeting, held on 13 February. It had before it decision 1/CP.20, the report of the ADP on

all  Parties  before  May  2015.13  The  Co-Chairs  reminded  Parties  that  this  negotiating  text 
was  to  be  derived  from  the  annex  to  decision  1/CP.20,  titled  “Lima  Call  for  Climate 
Action.” They noted that this text was to fully reflect the positions of all Parties. 

In accordance with this deadline, the Co-Chairs stressed their commitment to deliver 
14. 
and make available the negotiating text of the 2015 agreement by the closing plenary, on 13 
February. 

The Co-Chairs called upon the ADP to streamline the text’s language and eliminate 
15. 
redundancies  and  duplications,  better  present  alternatives  and  divergences,  and  clarify,  to 
the extent possible, proposals and concepts contained therein. 

16. 
In the interest of further refining the text over the course of future sessions, the Co-
Chairs  encouraged  Parties  to  consider  what  language  in  the  existing  text  might  be  most 
suitable  for  the  agreement,  and  what  might  be  more  appropriate  for  accompanying 
decisions. 

17. 
The  ADP  worked  sequentially  through  the  language  of  the  annex  to  decision 
1/CP.20 in an effort to develop the negotiating text. Each section was updated and further 
revised as requested by Parties, in an open and transparent manner.  Each revised iteration 
of the text was made available on the UNFCCC website. On 12 February, the sections were 
consolidated into a single document and made available as an advance unedited version on 
the UNFCCC website.14 

18. 
Further, in the context of its work on agenda item 3, the contact group referred to in 
paragraph  9  above  held  meetings  to  explore  broader  substantive  questions  related  to  the 
2015 agreement and ideas on how to make significant progress in the June session.15 The 
Co-Chairs informed Parties of their intention to issue a scenario note in order to facilitate 
preparations for that June session. 

19. 
In  the  context  of  work  on  pre-2020  climate  action,  including  on  how  to  further 
advance workstream 2, the contact group exchanged views on how to implement decision 
1/CP.19,  in  particular  paragraphs  3–5,  and  decision  1/CP.20,  in  particular  paragraphs  17–
20.  The  ADP  held  a  dedicated  meeting  on  how  to  advance  the  technical  examination 
process on 10 February.16  

20.  At  the  16th  meeting,  the  ADP  had  before  it  the  advance  unedited  version  of  the 
negotiating text, referred to in the last sentence of paragraph 17 above, and agreed that this 
text accurately reflects the proposals of all Parties and is the negotiating text that the ADP 
will use to start substantive negotiations at its next session. 

Following 

the  COP  mandate, 

the  Co-Chairs  requested 

to 
21. 
communicate  the  negotiating  text,  referred  to  in  paragraph  17  above,  to  Parties  in 
accordance  with  provisions  of  the  Convention  and  the  draft  rules  of  procedure  being 
applied, while noting that such communication will not prejudice whether the outcome will 
be  a  protocol,  another  legal  instrument  or  an  agreed  outcome  with  legal  force  under  the 
Convention applicable to all Parties.17

INDCs well in advance of COP 21 (by the first quarter of 2015 by those Parties ready to do 
so),19 the objective of the briefing, which took place on 9 February, was to update Parties on 
progress  in  delivering  existing  support  and  to  inform  Parties  of  other,  new  sources  of 
support for the preparation of INDCs. 

23.  At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs recalled that the ADP agreed to hold at least one 
additional session in the second half of 2015.20 The Co-Chairs requested the secretariat to 
make the necessary arrangements to organize two additional five-day sessions in the second 
half  of  the  year  in  Bonn,  Germany,  from  31  August  to  4  September  and  from  19  to  23 
October 2015. 

24. 
The  Co-Chairs  invited  the  secretariat  to  provide  delegates  with  information  on  the 
administrative  and  financial  implications  of,  and  on  the  status  of  funding  for,  additional 
sessions of the ADP in 2015. The Executive Secretary informed Parties that the secretariat 
has secured a venue for the two additional sessions of the ADP and that a total of USD 2 
million was still needed for these sessions. 

Statements  were  made  on  behalf  of  the  Presidency  of  COP  20/CMP  10  and  on 

25. 
behalf of the European Union and its 28 member States. 

IV.  Report on the eighth part of the second session 

(Agenda item 5) 

26.  At its 16th meeting, the ADP considered and adopted the draft report on the eighth 
part of its second session.21 At the same meeting, on a proposal of the Co-Chairs, the ADP 
authorized the Rapporteur to complete the report on the eighth part of the session, with the 
assistance of the secretariat and under the guidance of the Co-Chairs. 

V.  Suspension of the session 

27.  At its 16th meeting, the ADP agreed to the proposal of the Co-Chairs to suspend the 
second session and resume it in conjunction with the forty-second sessions of the subsidiary 
bodies in Bonn. 

28.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP  expressed  their  appreciation  to 
Parties for their work and support, and declared the second session of the ADP suspended.

I.  Opening of the session 

(Agenda item 1) 

The eighth part of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban 
1. 
Platform  for  Enhanced  Action  (ADP)  was  held  at  the  Palais  des  Nations,  Geneva, 
Switzerland, from 8 to 13 February 2015.1 

The  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP,  Mr.  Ahmed  Djoghlaf  (non-Annex  I)  and  Mr.  Daniel 
2. 
Reifsnyder (Annex I), resumed the second session of the ADP  by opening its 15th plenary 
meeting on 8 February 2015. They welcomed all Parties and observers as well as Ms. Yang 
Liu (non-Annex I), Rapporteur of the ADP.2 

A  statement  was  made  by  Mr.  Manuel  Pulgar-Vidal  (Peru),  President  of  the 
3. 
twentieth  session  of  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  (COP)  and  the  tenth  session  of  the 
Conference  of  the  Parties  serving  as  the  meeting  of  the  Parties  to  the  Kyoto  Protocol 
(CMP). 

The  Co-Chairs  informed  Parties  of  the  meetings  and  consultations  they  had  held 
4. 
with negotiating groups prior to the session, and voiced confidence that the promises made 
at  the  United  Nations  Climate  Change  Conference  held  in  Lima,  Peru,  would  be 
collectively fulfilled, including by concluding an ambitious and universal agreement at the 
United Nations Climate Change Conference to be held in in Paris, France. 

5. 
In  the  interest  of  fulfilling  the  mandate  given  in  decision  1/CP.17,  the  Co-Chairs 
encouraged Parties to convert the ‘elements’ text that emerged from the  Lima Conference 
into  the  negotiating  text  that  would  furnish  the  basis  for  work  in  2015  by  Friday,  13 
February. 

6. 
Statements  were submitted by representatives of 14 Parties, including on behalf of 
the  Group of 77 and  China, the European Union and its 28  member States, the Umbrella 
Group, the Environmental Integrity Group, the African Group, the Alliance of Small Island 
States, the least developed countries, the BASIC countries (Brazil, China, India and South 
Africa),  the  Like-minded  Developing  Countries,  the  Coalition  for  Rainforest  Nations,  the 
Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America – Peoples’ Trade Treaty, the League of 
Arab  States,  the  Independent  Association  for  Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean  and  the 
Caribbean Community.3 

7. 
Parties  demonstrated  great  initiative  and  a  spirit  of  cooperation  by  opting  to  post 
their  group  statements  on  the  web  rather  than  reading  them  aloud,  thereby  allowing  the 
work on substantive issues to start immediately.4 

1  The report on the first and second parts of the second session of the ADP is contained in document 
FCCC/ADP/2013/2; the reports on the third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh parts of the second 
session are contained in documents FCCC/ADP/2013/3, FCCC/ADP/2014/1, FCCC/ADP/2014/2,

current members of its Bureau at the seventh part of its second session, as reflected in document
