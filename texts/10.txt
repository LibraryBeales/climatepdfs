(Agenda item 1) 

1. 
The twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties (COP), convened pursuant 
to  Article  7,  paragraph  4,  of  the  Convention,  was  opened  at  the  United  Nations  Climate 
Change  Conference,  Paris–Le  Bourget,  France,  on  30  November  2015  by  Mr.  Manuel 
Pulgar-Vidal  (Peru),  President  of  COP  20.1  Mr.  Pulgar-Vidal  delivered  an  opening 
statement. 

The opening included statements made by the Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC, 

2.

II.  Organizational matters 

(Agenda item 2) 

A.  Election of the President of the Conference of the Parties at its  

twenty-first session 
(Agenda sub-item 2(a)) 

At  the  1st  meeting  of  the  COP,3  on  30  November,  the  President  of  COP  20, 
3. 
Mr. Pulgar-Vidal, recalled that, in accordance with rule 22, paragraph 1, of the draft rules 
of procedure being applied, the office of President of the COP is subject to rotation among 
the five regional groups. He informed Parties that a nomination had been received from the 
Western  European  and  other  States.  Following  his  proposal,  the  COP  elected  by 
acclamation  the  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs  and  International  Development  of  France, 
Mr. Laurent Fabius, as its President. A statement was made by the newly elected President.4 

B.  Adoption of the rules of procedure 

(Agenda sub-item 2(b)) 

At  the  2nd  meeting,  on  1  December,  the  President  recalled  that  the  President  of 
4. 
COP 20  had  proposed,  and  Parties  had  agreed,  that  he  would  conduct  intersessional 
consultations on this issue and inform the COP of any developments. As there continued to 
be  no  consensus  on  this  matter,  the  President  proposed  that,  as  at  previous  sessions,  the 
draft  rules  of  procedure  contained  in  document  FCCC/CP/1996/2  should  continue  to  be 
applied,  with  the  exception  of  draft  rule  42.  He  also  proposed  that  Mr.  Xavier  Sticker 
(France)  hold  informal  consultations  on  this  issue  and  report  back  to  the  COP  on  their 
outcome.  

At the 10th meeting, on 10 December, the President reported that there was still no 
5. 
consensus  on  this  issue.  On  a  proposal  by  the  President,  the  COP  agreed  to  continue  to 
apply  the  draft  rules  of  procedure  as  outlined  in  paragraph  4  above,  and  agreed  that  the 
President  would  continue  consultations  during  the  intersessional  period  and  would  report 
back at COP 22. 

1  COP 21 was held in conjunction with CMP 11. The proceedings of the CMP are contained in a 

separate report (FCCC/KP/CMP/2015/8). The proceedings of the joint meetings of the COP and the 
CMP convened during the sessions are reproduced in both reports.

prepared in agreement with the President of COP 20, after consultation with the Bureau of

document  FCCC/CP/2015/1,  with  the  exception  of  item  11,  “Second  review  of  the

Note: Data based on the most up-to-date amounts communicated by the Parties to the Convention 

in their national communications, greenhouse gas inventory reports, biennial reports or biennial 
update reports. Since the amounts communicated by the Parties to the Convention in many cases did 
not include data on emissions by source and removals by sinks from land use, land-use change and 
forestry, or, when included, these emissions by source and removals by sinks were estimated using 
different methodologies, these data were not included. Also, since the communicated amounts are for 
different years, the total amount provided in this table should be used solely for the limited purposes 
of Article 21 of the Paris Agreement as it does not represent an accurate estimate of global 
greenhouse gas emissions. 

a   Countries that are member States of the European Union. The emissions of the European 
Union were 4,488,404 gigagrams in 2013, which represents the sum of the emissions of its member 
States in this table, and corresponds to 12.08 per cent of the total emissions in this table. The 
emissions of the European Union are not counted as additional to those of the member States.

(Agenda item 1) 

1. 
The twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties (COP), convened pursuant 
to  Article  7,  paragraph  4,  of  the  Convention,  was  opened  at  the  United  Nations  Climate 
Change  Conference,  Paris–Le  Bourget,  France,  on  30  November  2015  by  Mr.  Manuel 
Pulgar-Vidal  (Peru),  President  of  COP  20.1  Mr.  Pulgar-Vidal  delivered  an  opening 
statement. 

The opening included statements made by the Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC,

II.  Organizational matters 

(Agenda item 2) 

A.  Election of the President of the Conference of the Parties at its  

twenty-first session 
(Agenda sub-item 2(a)) 

At  the  1st  meeting  of  the  COP,3  on  30  November,  the  President  of  COP  20, 
3. 
Mr. Pulgar-Vidal, recalled that, in accordance with rule 22, paragraph 1, of the draft rules 
of procedure being applied, the office of President of the COP is subject to rotation among 
the five regional groups. He informed Parties that a nomination had been received from the 
Western  European  and  other  States.  Following  his  proposal,  the  COP  elected  by 
acclamation  the  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs  and  International  Development  of  France, 
Mr. Laurent Fabius, as its President. A statement was made by the newly elected President.4 

B.  Adoption of the rules of procedure 

(Agenda sub-item 2(b)) 

At  the  2nd  meeting,  on  1  December,  the  President  recalled  that  the  President  of 
4. 
COP 20  had  proposed,  and  Parties  had  agreed,  that  he  would  conduct  intersessional 
consultations on this issue and inform the COP of any developments. As there continued to 
be  no  consensus  on  this  matter,  the  President  proposed  that,  as  at  previous  sessions,  the 
draft  rules  of  procedure  contained  in  document  FCCC/CP/1996/2  should  continue  to  be 
applied,  with  the  exception  of  draft  rule  42.  He  also  proposed  that  Mr.  Xavier  Sticker 
(France)  hold  informal  consultations  on  this  issue  and  report  back  to  the  COP  on  their 
outcome.  

At the 10th meeting, on 10 December, the President reported that there was still no 
5. 
consensus  on  this  issue.  On  a  proposal  by  the  President,  the  COP  agreed  to  continue  to 
apply  the  draft  rules  of  procedure  as  outlined  in  paragraph  4  above,  and  agreed  that  the 
President  would  continue  consultations  during  the  intersessional  period  and  would  report 
back at COP 22. 

1  COP 21 was held in conjunction with CMP 11. The proceedings of the CMP are contained in a 

separate report (FCCC/KP/CMP/2015/8). The proceedings of the joint meetings of the COP and the 
CMP convened during the sessions are reproduced in both reports.

sessions of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) and the 
Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) ended on 4 December. He also noted that, given

draft decisions, including the outcomes of the ADP process, all negotiations would have to 
conclude  by  9  December.  This  would  ensure  that  document  processing,  translation  into 
other official United Nations languages and the requisite legal and linguistic reviews could 
be completed in time to ensure a timely and orderly closure of the conference. 

21. 
The  President  also  informed  the  COP  that  separate  meetings  of  the  COP  and  the 
CMP  would  be  held  on  10  December  so  that  decisions  and  conclusions,  including  those

including  the  consideration  and  adoption  by  the  COP  of  the  outcomes  of  the  ADP 
negotiations.  

22. 
The  President  reminded  Parties  of  his  intent  to  ensure  a  Party-driven,  transparent 
and  inclusive  approach  with  proper  time  management,  including  beginning  meetings  on 
time,  ensuring  timely  closure  of  negotiations,  enforcing  agreed  working  practices  and 
ensuring that all meetings finish by 6 p.m. and only exceptionally by 9 p.m. He encouraged 
Parties to show creativity and flexibility in reaching agreement at the end of the session of 
each  body.  He  urged  the  Chairs  and  Co-Chairs  of  the  subsidiary  bodies  to  take  creative 
measures  to  ensure  proper  time  management  and  urged  that  every  effort  be  made  to 
maximize the meeting time available for discussions on substantive items under the COP.

Note: Data based on the most up-to-date amounts communicated by the Parties to the Convention 

in their national communications, greenhouse gas inventory reports, biennial reports or biennial 
update reports. Since the amounts communicated by the Parties to the Convention in many cases did 
not include data on emissions by source and removals by sinks from land use, land-use change and 
forestry, or, when included, these emissions by source and removals by sinks were estimated using 
different methodologies, these data were not included. Also, since the communicated amounts are for 
different years, the total amount provided in this table should be used solely for the limited purposes 
of Article 21 of the Paris Agreement as it does not represent an accurate estimate of global 
greenhouse gas emissions. 

a   Countries that are member States of the European Union. The emissions of the European 
Union were 4,488,404 gigagrams in 2013, which represents the sum of the emissions of its member 
States in this table, and corresponds to 12.08 per cent of the total emissions in this table. The 
emissions of the European Union are not counted as additional to those of the member States.

The twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties (COP), convened pursuant 
to  Article  7,  paragraph  4,  of  the  Convention,  was  opened  at  the  United  Nations  Climate 
Change  Conference,  Paris–Le  Bourget,  France,  on  30  November  2015  by  Mr.  Manuel 
Pulgar-Vidal  (Peru),  President  of  COP  20.1  Mr.  Pulgar-Vidal  delivered  an  opening 
statement. 

The opening included statements made by the Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC,

II.  Organizational matters 

(Agenda item 2) 

A.  Election of the President of the Conference of the Parties at its  

twenty-first session 
(Agenda sub-item 2(a)) 

At  the  1st  meeting  of  the  COP,3  on  30  November,  the  President  of  COP  20, 
3. 
Mr. Pulgar-Vidal, recalled that, in accordance with rule 22, paragraph 1, of the draft rules 
of procedure being applied, the office of President of the COP is subject to rotation among 
the five regional groups. He informed Parties that a nomination had been received from the 
Western  European  and  other  States.  Following  his  proposal,  the  COP  elected  by 
acclamation  the  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs  and  International  Development  of  France, 
Mr. Laurent Fabius, as its President. A statement was made by the newly elected President.4 

B.  Adoption of the rules of procedure 

(Agenda sub-item 2(b)) 

At  the  2nd  meeting,  on  1  December,  the  President  recalled  that  the  President  of 
4. 
COP 20  had  proposed,  and  Parties  had  agreed,  that  he  would  conduct  intersessional 
consultations on this issue and inform the COP of any developments. As there continued to 
be  no  consensus  on  this  matter,  the  President  proposed  that,  as  at  previous  sessions,  the 
draft  rules  of  procedure  contained  in  document  FCCC/CP/1996/2  should  continue  to  be 
applied,  with  the  exception  of  draft  rule  42.  He  also  proposed  that  Mr.  Xavier  Sticker 
(France)  hold  informal  consultations  on  this  issue  and  report  back  to  the  COP  on  their 
outcome.  

At the 10th meeting, on 10 December, the President reported that there was still no 
5. 
consensus  on  this  issue.  On  a  proposal  by  the  President,  the  COP  agreed  to  continue  to 
apply  the  draft  rules  of  procedure  as  outlined  in  paragraph  4  above,  and  agreed  that  the 
President  would  continue  consultations  during  the  intersessional  period  and  would  report 
back at COP 22. 

1  COP 21 was held in conjunction with CMP 11. The proceedings of the CMP are contained in a 

separate report (FCCC/KP/CMP/2015/8). The proceedings of the joint meetings of the COP and the 
CMP convened during the sessions are reproduced in both reports.

Note: Data based on the most up-to-date amounts communicated by the Parties to the Convention 

in their national communications, greenhouse gas inventory reports, biennial reports or biennial 
update reports. Since the amounts communicated by the Parties to the Convention in many cases did 
not include data on emissions by source and removals by sinks from land use, land-use change and 
forestry, or, when included, these emissions by source and removals by sinks were estimated using 
different methodologies, these data were not included. Also, since the communicated amounts are for 
different years, the total amount provided in this table should be used solely for the limited purposes 
of Article 21 of the Paris Agreement as it does not represent an accurate estimate of global 
greenhouse gas emissions. 

a   Countries that are member States of the European Union. The emissions of the European 
Union were 4,488,404 gigagrams in 2013, which represents the sum of the emissions of its member 
States in this table, and corresponds to 12.08 per cent of the total emissions in this table. The 
emissions of the European Union are not counted as additional to those of the member States.

(Agenda item 1) 

1. 
The twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties (COP), convened pursuant 
to  Article  7,  paragraph  4,  of  the  Convention,  was  opened  at  the  United  Nations  Climate 
Change  Conference,  Paris–Le  Bourget,  France,  on  30  November  2015  by  Mr.  Manuel 
Pulgar-Vidal  (Peru),  President  of  COP  20.1  Mr.  Pulgar-Vidal  delivered  an  opening 
statement. 

The opening included statements made by the Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC, 

2. 
Ms. Christiana Figueres, and His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales.2 

II.  Organizational matters 

(Agenda item 2) 

A.  Election of the President of the Conference of the Parties at its  

twenty-first session 
(Agenda sub-item 2(a)) 

At  the  1st  meeting  of  the  COP,3  on  30  November,  the  President  of  COP  20, 
3. 
Mr. Pulgar-Vidal, recalled that, in accordance with rule 22, paragraph 1, of the draft rules 
of procedure being applied, the office of President of the COP is subject to rotation among 
the five regional groups. He informed Parties that a nomination had been received from the 
Western  European  and  other  States.  Following  his  proposal,  the  COP  elected  by 
acclamation  the  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs  and  International  Development  of  France, 
Mr. Laurent Fabius, as its President. A statement was made by the newly elected President.4 

B.  Adoption of the rules of procedure 

(Agenda sub-item 2(b)) 

At  the  2nd  meeting,  on  1  December,  the  President  recalled  that  the  President  of 
4. 
COP 20  had  proposed,  and  Parties  had  agreed,  that  he  would  conduct  intersessional 
consultations on this issue and inform the COP of any developments. As there continued to 
be  no  consensus  on  this  matter,  the  President  proposed  that,  as  at  previous  sessions,  the 
draft  rules  of  procedure  contained  in  document  FCCC/CP/1996/2  should  continue  to  be 
applied,  with  the  exception  of  draft  rule  42.  He  also  proposed  that  Mr.  Xavier  Sticker 
(France)  hold  informal  consultations  on  this  issue  and  report  back  to  the  COP  on  their 
outcome.  

At the 10th meeting, on 10 December, the President reported that there was still no 
5. 
consensus  on  this  issue.  On  a  proposal  by  the  President,  the  COP  agreed  to  continue  to 
apply  the  draft  rules  of  procedure  as  outlined  in  paragraph  4  above,  and  agreed  that  the 
President  would  continue  consultations  during  the  intersessional  period  and  would  report 
back at COP 22. 

1  COP 21 was held in conjunction with CMP 11. The proceedings of the CMP are contained in a 

separate report (FCCC/KP/CMP/2015/8). The proceedings of the joint meetings of the COP and the 
CMP convened during the sessions are reproduced in both reports.

prepared in agreement with the President of COP 20, after consultation with the Bureau of

The  President  proposed  that  the  provisional  agenda  be  adopted  as  contained  in 
document  FCCC/CP/2015/1,  with  the  exception  of  item  11,  “Second  review  of  the

Note: Data based on the most up-to-date amounts communicated by the Parties to the Convention 

in their national communications, greenhouse gas inventory reports, biennial reports or biennial 
update reports. Since the amounts communicated by the Parties to the Convention in many cases did 
not include data on emissions by source and removals by sinks from land use, land-use change and 
forestry, or, when included, these emissions by source and removals by sinks were estimated using 
different methodologies, these data were not included. Also, since the communicated amounts are for 
different years, the total amount provided in this table should be used solely for the limited purposes 
of Article 21 of the Paris Agreement as it does not represent an accurate estimate of global 
greenhouse gas emissions. 

a   Countries that are member States of the European Union. The emissions of the European 
Union were 4,488,404 gigagrams in 2013, which represents the sum of the emissions of its member 
States in this table, and corresponds to 12.08 per cent of the total emissions in this table. The 
emissions of the European Union are not counted as additional to those of the member States.

(Agenda item 1) 

1. 
The twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties (COP), convened pursuant 
to  Article  7,  paragraph  4,  of  the  Convention,  was  opened  at  the  United  Nations  Climate 
Change  Conference,  Paris–Le  Bourget,  France,  on  30  November  2015  by  Mr.  Manuel 
Pulgar-Vidal  (Peru),  President  of  COP  20.1  Mr.  Pulgar-Vidal  delivered  an  opening 
statement. 

The opening included statements made by the Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC,

II.  Organizational matters 

(Agenda item 2) 

A.  Election of the President of the Conference of the Parties at its  

twenty-first session 
(Agenda sub-item 2(a)) 

At  the  1st  meeting  of  the  COP,3  on  30  November,  the  President  of  COP  20, 
3. 
Mr. Pulgar-Vidal, recalled that, in accordance with rule 22, paragraph 1, of the draft rules 
of procedure being applied, the office of President of the COP is subject to rotation among 
the five regional groups. He informed Parties that a nomination had been received from the 
Western  European  and  other  States.  Following  his  proposal,  the  COP  elected  by 
acclamation  the  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs  and  International  Development  of  France, 
Mr. Laurent Fabius, as its President. A statement was made by the newly elected President.4 

B.  Adoption of the rules of procedure 

(Agenda sub-item 2(b)) 

At  the  2nd  meeting,  on  1  December,  the  President  recalled  that  the  President  of 
4. 
COP 20  had  proposed,  and  Parties  had  agreed,  that  he  would  conduct  intersessional 
consultations on this issue and inform the COP of any developments. As there continued to 
be  no  consensus  on  this  matter,  the  President  proposed  that,  as  at  previous  sessions,  the 
draft  rules  of  procedure  contained  in  document  FCCC/CP/1996/2  should  continue  to  be 
applied,  with  the  exception  of  draft  rule  42.  He  also  proposed  that  Mr.  Xavier  Sticker 
(France)  hold  informal  consultations  on  this  issue  and  report  back  to  the  COP  on  their 
outcome.  

At the 10th meeting, on 10 December, the President reported that there was still no 
5. 
consensus  on  this  issue.  On  a  proposal  by  the  President,  the  COP  agreed  to  continue  to 
apply  the  draft  rules  of  procedure  as  outlined  in  paragraph  4  above,  and  agreed  that  the 
President  would  continue  consultations  during  the  intersessional  period  and  would  report 
back at COP 22. 

1  COP 21 was held in conjunction with CMP 11. The proceedings of the CMP are contained in a 

separate report (FCCC/KP/CMP/2015/8). The proceedings of the joint meetings of the COP and the 
CMP convened during the sessions are reproduced in both reports.

prepared in agreement with the President of COP 20, after consultation with the Bureau of

The  President  proposed  that  the  provisional  agenda  be  adopted  as  contained  in 
document  FCCC/CP/2015/1,  with  the  exception  of  item  11,  “Second  review  of  the

developing  draft  decisions  and  conclusions  for  consideration  by  the  COP  before  the 
sessions of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) and the 
Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) ended on 4 December. He also noted that, given 
the challenges of time management during the session of the COP, it would not be possible 
to extend the sessions of the subsidiary bodies. He further noted that the Ad Hoc Working 
Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action (ADP) would submit the results of its 
work to the COP on 5 December. 

16.

20. 
The President informed the COP that, to enable the COP and the CMP to adopt all 
draft decisions, including the outcomes of the ADP process, all negotiations would have to 
conclude  by  9  December.  This  would  ensure  that  document  processing,  translation  into 
other official United Nations languages and the requisite legal and linguistic reviews could 
be completed in time to ensure a timely and orderly closure of the conference. 

21. 
The  President  also  informed  the  COP  that  separate  meetings  of  the  COP  and  the 
CMP  would  be  held  on  10  December  so  that  decisions  and  conclusions,  including  those 
recommended  at  the  sessions  of  the  subsidiary  bodies,  could  be  adopted.  He  further 
informed the COP that the COP and the CMP would complete their work on 11 December, 
including  the  consideration  and  adoption  by  the  COP  of  the  outcomes  of  the  ADP 
negotiations.  

22. 
The  President  reminded  Parties  of  his  intent  to  ensure  a  Party-driven,  transparent 
and  inclusive  approach  with  proper  time  management,  including  beginning  meetings  on 
time,  ensuring  timely  closure  of  negotiations,  enforcing  agreed  working  practices  and 
ensuring that all meetings finish by 6 p.m. and only exceptionally by 9 p.m. He encouraged 
Parties to show creativity and flexibility in reaching agreement at the end of the session of 
each  body.  He  urged  the  Chairs  and  Co-Chairs  of  the  subsidiary  bodies  to  take  creative 
measures  to  ensure  proper  time  management  and  urged  that  every  effort  be  made  to 
maximize the meeting time available for discussions on substantive items under the COP.

27.  At the 4th meeting, on 2 December, the President reported that the African States had 
communicated to the secretariat their endorsement of Morocco  as the host of COP 22 and 
CMP 12 in 2016. The President invited Parties to come forward with offers to host COP 23 
and  CMP  13  in  2017  and  noted  that,  in  keeping  with  the  principle  of  rotation  among  the 
regional groups, the President of COP 23 and CMP 13 would come from the Asia-Pacific 
States. He also invited Parties to come forward with offers to host COP 24 and CMP 14 in 
2018 and noted that, in keeping  with the  principle of rotation among the regional groups, 
the President of COP 24 and CMP 14 would come from the Eastern European States.

Note: Data based on the most up-to-date amounts communicated by the Parties to the Convention 

in their national communications, greenhouse gas inventory reports, biennial reports or biennial 
update reports. Since the amounts communicated by the Parties to the Convention in many cases did 
not include data on emissions by source and removals by sinks from land use, land-use change and 
forestry, or, when included, these emissions by source and removals by sinks were estimated using 
different methodologies, these data were not included. Also, since the communicated amounts are for 
different years, the total amount provided in this table should be used solely for the limited purposes 
of Article 21 of the Paris Agreement as it does not represent an accurate estimate of global 
greenhouse gas emissions. 

a   Countries that are member States of the European Union. The emissions of the European 
Union were 4,488,404 gigagrams in 2013, which represents the sum of the emissions of its member 
States in this table, and corresponds to 12.08 per cent of the total emissions in this table. The 
emissions of the European Union are not counted as additional to those of the member States.

3. 
Mr. Pulgar-Vidal, recalled that, in accordance with rule 22, paragraph 1, of the draft rules

Note: Data based on the most up-to-date amounts communicated by the Parties to the Convention 

in their national communications, greenhouse gas inventory reports, biennial reports or biennial 
update reports. Since the amounts communicated by the Parties to the Convention in many cases did 
not include data on emissions by source and removals by sinks from land use, land-use change and 
forestry, or, when included, these emissions by source and removals by sinks were estimated using 
different methodologies, these data were not included. Also, since the communicated amounts are for 
different years, the total amount provided in this table should be used solely for the limited purposes 
of Article 21 of the Paris Agreement as it does not represent an accurate estimate of global 
greenhouse gas emissions. 

a   Countries that are member States of the European Union. The emissions of the European 
Union were 4,488,404 gigagrams in 2013, which represents the sum of the emissions of its member 
States in this table, and corresponds to 12.08 per cent of the total emissions in this table. The 
emissions of the European Union are not counted as additional to those of the member States.

(Agenda item 1)

The twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties (COP), convened pursuant 
to  Article  7,  paragraph  4,  of  the  Convention,  was  opened  at  the  United  Nations  Climate 
Change  Conference,  Paris–Le  Bourget,  France,  on  30  November  2015  by  Mr.  Manuel 
Pulgar-Vidal  (Peru),  President  of  COP  20.1  Mr.  Pulgar-Vidal  delivered  an  opening 
statement. 

The opening included statements made by the Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC, 

2.

II.  Organizational matters 

(Agenda item 2) 

A.  Election of the President of the Conference of the Parties at its  

twenty-first session 
(Agenda sub-item 2(a)) 

At  the  1st  meeting  of  the  COP,3  on  30  November,  the  President  of  COP  20, 
3. 
Mr. Pulgar-Vidal, recalled that, in accordance with rule 22, paragraph 1, of the draft rules 
of procedure being applied, the office of President of the COP is subject to rotation among 
the five regional groups. He informed Parties that a nomination had been received from the 
Western  European  and  other  States.  Following  his  proposal,  the  COP  elected  by 
acclamation  the  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs  and  International  Development  of  France, 
Mr. Laurent Fabius, as its President. A statement was made by the newly elected President.4 

B.  Adoption of the rules of procedure 

(Agenda sub-item 2(b)) 

At  the  2nd  meeting,  on  1  December,  the  President  recalled  that  the  President  of 
4. 
COP 20  had  proposed,  and  Parties  had  agreed,  that  he  would  conduct  intersessional 
consultations on this issue and inform the COP of any developments. As there continued to 
be  no  consensus  on  this  matter,  the  President  proposed  that,  as  at  previous  sessions,  the 
draft  rules  of  procedure  contained  in  document  FCCC/CP/1996/2  should  continue  to  be 
applied,  with  the  exception  of  draft  rule  42.  He  also  proposed  that  Mr.  Xavier  Sticker 
(France)  hold  informal  consultations  on  this  issue  and  report  back  to  the  COP  on  their 
outcome.  

At the 10th meeting, on 10 December, the President reported that there was still no 
5. 
consensus  on  this  issue.  On  a  proposal  by  the  President,  the  COP  agreed  to  continue  to 
apply  the  draft  rules  of  procedure  as  outlined  in  paragraph  4  above,  and  agreed  that  the 
President  would  continue  consultations  during  the  intersessional  period  and  would  report 
back at COP 22. 

1  COP 21 was held in conjunction with CMP 11. The proceedings of the CMP are contained in a 

separate report (FCCC/KP/CMP/2015/8). The proceedings of the joint meetings of the COP and the 
CMP convened during the sessions are reproduced in both reports.

prepared in agreement with the President of COP 20, after consultation with the Bureau of

document  FCCC/CP/2015/1,  with  the  exception  of  item  11,  “Second  review  of  the

the challenges of time management during the session of the COP, it would not be possible 
to extend the sessions of the subsidiary bodies. He further noted that the Ad Hoc Working 
Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action (ADP) would submit the results of its 
work to the COP on 5 December.

and  inclusive  approach  with  proper  time  management,  including  beginning  meetings  on 
time,  ensuring  timely  closure  of  negotiations,  enforcing  agreed  working  practices  and

Note: Data based on the most up-to-date amounts communicated by the Parties to the Convention 

in their national communications, greenhouse gas inventory reports, biennial reports or biennial 
update reports. Since the amounts communicated by the Parties to the Convention in many cases did 
not include data on emissions by source and removals by sinks from land use, land-use change and 
forestry, or, when included, these emissions by source and removals by sinks were estimated using 
different methodologies, these data were not included. Also, since the communicated amounts are for 
different years, the total amount provided in this table should be used solely for the limited purposes 
of Article 21 of the Paris Agreement as it does not represent an accurate estimate of global 
greenhouse gas emissions. 

a   Countries that are member States of the European Union. The emissions of the European 
Union were 4,488,404 gigagrams in 2013, which represents the sum of the emissions of its member 
States in this table, and corresponds to 12.08 per cent of the total emissions in this table. The 
emissions of the European Union are not counted as additional to those of the member States.

(Agenda item 1) 

1. 
The twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties (COP), convened pursuant 
to  Article  7,  paragraph  4,  of  the  Convention,  was  opened  at  the  United  Nations  Climate 
Change  Conference,  Paris–Le  Bourget,  France,  on  30  November  2015  by  Mr.  Manuel 
Pulgar-Vidal  (Peru),  President  of  COP  20.1  Mr.  Pulgar-Vidal  delivered  an  opening 
statement. 

The opening included statements made by the Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC, 

2.

II.  Organizational matters 

(Agenda item 2) 

A.  Election of the President of the Conference of the Parties at its  

twenty-first session 
(Agenda sub-item 2(a)) 

At  the  1st  meeting  of  the  COP,3  on  30  November,  the  President  of  COP  20, 
3. 
Mr. Pulgar-Vidal, recalled that, in accordance with rule 22, paragraph 1, of the draft rules 
of procedure being applied, the office of President of the COP is subject to rotation among 
the five regional groups. He informed Parties that a nomination had been received from the 
Western  European  and  other  States.  Following  his  proposal,  the  COP  elected  by 
acclamation  the  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs  and  International  Development  of  France, 
Mr. Laurent Fabius, as its President. A statement was made by the newly elected President.4 

B.  Adoption of the rules of procedure 

(Agenda sub-item 2(b)) 

At  the  2nd  meeting,  on  1  December,  the  President  recalled  that  the  President  of 
4. 
COP 20  had  proposed,  and  Parties  had  agreed,  that  he  would  conduct  intersessional 
consultations on this issue and inform the COP of any developments. As there continued to 
be  no  consensus  on  this  matter,  the  President  proposed  that,  as  at  previous  sessions,  the 
draft  rules  of  procedure  contained  in  document  FCCC/CP/1996/2  should  continue  to  be 
applied,  with  the  exception  of  draft  rule  42.  He  also  proposed  that  Mr.  Xavier  Sticker 
(France)  hold  informal  consultations  on  this  issue  and  report  back  to  the  COP  on  their 
outcome.  

At the 10th meeting, on 10 December, the President reported that there was still no 
5. 
consensus  on  this  issue.  On  a  proposal  by  the  President,  the  COP  agreed  to  continue  to 
apply  the  draft  rules  of  procedure  as  outlined  in  paragraph  4  above,  and  agreed  that  the 
President  would  continue  consultations  during  the  intersessional  period  and  would  report 
back at COP 22. 

1  COP 21 was held in conjunction with CMP 11. The proceedings of the CMP are contained in a 

separate report (FCCC/KP/CMP/2015/8). The proceedings of the joint meetings of the COP and the 
CMP convened during the sessions are reproduced in both reports.

prepared in agreement with the President of COP 20, after consultation with the Bureau of

The  President  proposed  that  the  provisional  agenda  be  adopted  as  contained  in 
document  FCCC/CP/2015/1,  with  the  exception  of  item  11,  “Second  review  of  the

developing  draft  decisions  and  conclusions  for  consideration  by  the  COP  before  the 
sessions of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) and the 
Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) ended on 4 December. He also noted that, given 
the challenges of time management during the session of the COP, it would not be possible 
to extend the sessions of the subsidiary bodies. He further noted that the Ad Hoc Working 
Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action (ADP) would submit the results of its 
work to the COP on 5 December. 

16.

20. 
The President informed the COP that, to enable the COP and the CMP to adopt all 
draft decisions, including the outcomes of the ADP process, all negotiations would have to 
conclude  by  9  December.  This  would  ensure  that  document  processing,  translation  into 
other official United Nations languages and the requisite legal and linguistic reviews could 
be completed in time to ensure a timely and orderly closure of the conference. 

21. 
The  President  also  informed  the  COP  that  separate  meetings  of  the  COP  and  the 
CMP  would  be  held  on  10  December  so  that  decisions  and  conclusions,  including  those 
recommended  at  the  sessions  of  the  subsidiary  bodies,  could  be  adopted.  He  further 
informed the COP that the COP and the CMP would complete their work on 11 December, 
including  the  consideration  and  adoption  by  the  COP  of  the  outcomes  of  the  ADP 
negotiations.  

22. 
The  President  reminded  Parties  of  his  intent  to  ensure  a  Party-driven,  transparent 
and  inclusive  approach  with  proper  time  management,  including  beginning  meetings  on 
time,  ensuring  timely  closure  of  negotiations,  enforcing  agreed  working  practices  and 
ensuring that all meetings finish by 6 p.m. and only exceptionally by 9 p.m. He encouraged 
Parties to show creativity and flexibility in reaching agreement at the end of the session of 
each  body.  He  urged  the  Chairs  and  Co-Chairs  of  the  subsidiary  bodies  to  take  creative 
measures  to  ensure  proper  time  management  and  urged  that  every  effort  be  made  to 
maximize the meeting time available for discussions on substantive items under the COP.

Note: Data based on the most up-to-date amounts communicated by the Parties to the Convention 

in their national communications, greenhouse gas inventory reports, biennial reports or biennial 
update reports. Since the amounts communicated by the Parties to the Convention in many cases did 
not include data on emissions by source and removals by sinks from land use, land-use change and 
forestry, or, when included, these emissions by source and removals by sinks were estimated using 
different methodologies, these data were not included. Also, since the communicated amounts are for 
different years, the total amount provided in this table should be used solely for the limited purposes 
of Article 21 of the Paris Agreement as it does not represent an accurate estimate of global 
greenhouse gas emissions. 

a   Countries that are member States of the European Union. The emissions of the European 
Union were 4,488,404 gigagrams in 2013, which represents the sum of the emissions of its member 
States in this table, and corresponds to 12.08 per cent of the total emissions in this table. The 
emissions of the European Union are not counted as additional to those of the member States.

(Agenda item 2) 

A.  Election of the President of the Conference of the Parties at its  

twenty-first session 
(Agenda sub-item 2(a)) 

At  the  1st  meeting  of  the  COP,3  on  30  November,  the  President  of  COP  20, 
3. 
Mr. Pulgar-Vidal, recalled that, in accordance with rule 22, paragraph 1, of the draft rules 
of procedure being applied, the office of President of the COP is subject to rotation among 
the five regional groups. He informed Parties that a nomination had been received from the 
Western  European  and  other  States.  Following  his  proposal,  the  COP  elected  by 
acclamation  the  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs  and  International  Development  of  France, 
Mr. Laurent Fabius, as its President. A statement was made by the newly elected President.4 

B.  Adoption of the rules of procedure 

(Agenda sub-item 2(b)) 

At  the  2nd  meeting,  on  1  December,  the  President  recalled  that  the  President  of 
4. 
COP 20  had  proposed,  and  Parties  had  agreed,  that  he  would  conduct  intersessional 
consultations on this issue and inform the COP of any developments. As there continued to 
be  no  consensus  on  this  matter,  the  President  proposed  that,  as  at  previous  sessions,  the 
draft  rules  of  procedure  contained  in  document  FCCC/CP/1996/2  should  continue  to  be 
applied,  with  the  exception  of  draft  rule  42.  He  also  proposed  that  Mr.  Xavier  Sticker 
(France)  hold  informal  consultations  on  this  issue  and  report  back  to  the  COP  on  their 
outcome.  

At the 10th meeting, on 10 December, the President reported that there was still no 
5. 
consensus  on  this  issue.  On  a  proposal  by  the  President,  the  COP  agreed  to  continue  to 
apply  the  draft  rules  of  procedure  as  outlined  in  paragraph  4  above,  and  agreed  that  the 
President  would  continue  consultations  during  the  intersessional  period  and  would  report 
back at COP 22. 

1  COP 21 was held in conjunction with CMP 11. The proceedings of the CMP are contained in a 

separate report (FCCC/KP/CMP/2015/8). The proceedings of the joint meetings of the COP and the

prepared in agreement with the President of COP 20, after consultation with the Bureau of 
the COP.

The  President  proposed  that  the  provisional  agenda  be  adopted  as  contained  in 
document  FCCC/CP/2015/1,  with  the  exception  of  item  11,  “Second  review  of  the

Note: Data based on the most up-to-date amounts communicated by the Parties to the Convention 

in their national communications, greenhouse gas inventory reports, biennial reports or biennial 
update reports. Since the amounts communicated by the Parties to the Convention in many cases did 
not include data on emissions by source and removals by sinks from land use, land-use change and 
forestry, or, when included, these emissions by source and removals by sinks were estimated using 
different methodologies, these data were not included. Also, since the communicated amounts are for 
different years, the total amount provided in this table should be used solely for the limited purposes 
of Article 21 of the Paris Agreement as it does not represent an accurate estimate of global 
greenhouse gas emissions. 

a   Countries that are member States of the European Union. The emissions of the European 
Union were 4,488,404 gigagrams in 2013, which represents the sum of the emissions of its member 
States in this table, and corresponds to 12.08 per cent of the total emissions in this table. The 
emissions of the European Union are not counted as additional to those of the member States.

The twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties (COP), convened pursuant 
to  Article  7,  paragraph  4,  of  the  Convention,  was  opened  at  the  United  Nations  Climate 
Change  Conference,  Paris–Le  Bourget,  France,  on  30  November  2015  by  Mr.  Manuel 
Pulgar-Vidal  (Peru),  President  of  COP  20.1  Mr.  Pulgar-Vidal  delivered  an  opening 
statement. 

The opening included statements made by the Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC,

II.  Organizational matters 

(Agenda item 2) 

A.  Election of the President of the Conference of the Parties at its  

twenty-first session 
(Agenda sub-item 2(a)) 

At  the  1st  meeting  of  the  COP,3  on  30  November,  the  President  of  COP  20, 
3. 
Mr. Pulgar-Vidal, recalled that, in accordance with rule 22, paragraph 1, of the draft rules 
of procedure being applied, the office of President of the COP is subject to rotation among 
the five regional groups. He informed Parties that a nomination had been received from the 
Western  European  and  other  States.  Following  his  proposal,  the  COP  elected  by 
acclamation  the  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs  and  International  Development  of  France, 
Mr. Laurent Fabius, as its President. A statement was made by the newly elected President.4 

B.  Adoption of the rules of procedure 

(Agenda sub-item 2(b)) 

At  the  2nd  meeting,  on  1  December,  the  President  recalled  that  the  President  of 
4. 
COP 20  had  proposed,  and  Parties  had  agreed,  that  he  would  conduct  intersessional 
consultations on this issue and inform the COP of any developments. As there continued to 
be  no  consensus  on  this  matter,  the  President  proposed  that,  as  at  previous  sessions,  the 
draft  rules  of  procedure  contained  in  document  FCCC/CP/1996/2  should  continue  to  be 
applied,  with  the  exception  of  draft  rule  42.  He  also  proposed  that  Mr.  Xavier  Sticker 
(France)  hold  informal  consultations  on  this  issue  and  report  back  to  the  COP  on  their 
outcome.  

At the 10th meeting, on 10 December, the President reported that there was still no 
5. 
consensus  on  this  issue.  On  a  proposal  by  the  President,  the  COP  agreed  to  continue  to 
apply  the  draft  rules  of  procedure  as  outlined  in  paragraph  4  above,  and  agreed  that  the 
President  would  continue  consultations  during  the  intersessional  period  and  would  report 
back at COP 22. 

1  COP 21 was held in conjunction with CMP 11. The proceedings of the CMP are contained in a 

separate report (FCCC/KP/CMP/2015/8). The proceedings of the joint meetings of the COP and the 
CMP convened during the sessions are reproduced in both reports.

C.  Adoption of the agenda 
(Agenda sub-item 2(c)) 

At its 2nd meeting, the COP considered a note by the Executive Secretary containing

prepared in agreement with the President of COP 20, after consultation with the Bureau of 
the COP. 

7. 
The  President  proposed  that  the  provisional  agenda  be  adopted  as  contained  in 
document  FCCC/CP/2015/1,  with  the  exception  of  item  11,  “Second  review  of  the

Note: Data based on the most up-to-date amounts communicated by the Parties to the Convention 

in their national communications, greenhouse gas inventory reports, biennial reports or biennial 
update reports. Since the amounts communicated by the Parties to the Convention in many cases did 
not include data on emissions by source and removals by sinks from land use, land-use change and 
forestry, or, when included, these emissions by source and removals by sinks were estimated using 
different methodologies, these data were not included. Also, since the communicated amounts are for 
different years, the total amount provided in this table should be used solely for the limited purposes 
of Article 21 of the Paris Agreement as it does not represent an accurate estimate of global 
greenhouse gas emissions. 

a   Countries that are member States of the European Union. The emissions of the European 
Union were 4,488,404 gigagrams in 2013, which represents the sum of the emissions of its member 
States in this table, and corresponds to 12.08 per cent of the total emissions in this table. The 
emissions of the European Union are not counted as additional to those of the member States.

The twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties (COP), convened pursuant 
to  Article  7,  paragraph  4,  of  the  Convention,  was  opened  at  the  United  Nations  Climate 
Change  Conference,  Paris–Le  Bourget,  France,  on  30  November  2015  by  Mr.  Manuel 
Pulgar-Vidal  (Peru),  President  of  COP  20.1  Mr.  Pulgar-Vidal  delivered  an  opening 
statement. 

The opening included statements made by the Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC,

II.  Organizational matters 

(Agenda item 2) 

A.  Election of the President of the Conference of the Parties at its  

twenty-first session 
(Agenda sub-item 2(a)) 

At  the  1st  meeting  of  the  COP,3  on  30  November,  the  President  of  COP  20, 
3. 
Mr. Pulgar-Vidal, recalled that, in accordance with rule 22, paragraph 1, of the draft rules 
of procedure being applied, the office of President of the COP is subject to rotation among 
the five regional groups. He informed Parties that a nomination had been received from the 
Western  European  and  other  States.  Following  his  proposal,  the  COP  elected  by 
acclamation  the  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs  and  International  Development  of  France, 
Mr. Laurent Fabius, as its President. A statement was made by the newly elected President.4 

B.  Adoption of the rules of procedure 

(Agenda sub-item 2(b)) 

At  the  2nd  meeting,  on  1  December,  the  President  recalled  that  the  President  of 
4. 
COP 20  had  proposed,  and  Parties  had  agreed,  that  he  would  conduct  intersessional 
consultations on this issue and inform the COP of any developments. As there continued to 
be  no  consensus  on  this  matter,  the  President  proposed  that,  as  at  previous  sessions,  the 
draft  rules  of  procedure  contained  in  document  FCCC/CP/1996/2  should  continue  to  be 
applied,  with  the  exception  of  draft  rule  42.  He  also  proposed  that  Mr.  Xavier  Sticker 
(France)  hold  informal  consultations  on  this  issue  and  report  back  to  the  COP  on  their 
outcome.  

At the 10th meeting, on 10 December, the President reported that there was still no 
5. 
consensus  on  this  issue.  On  a  proposal  by  the  President,  the  COP  agreed  to  continue  to 
apply  the  draft  rules  of  procedure  as  outlined  in  paragraph  4  above,  and  agreed  that  the 
President  would  continue  consultations  during  the  intersessional  period  and  would  report 
back at COP 22. 

1  COP 21 was held in conjunction with CMP 11. The proceedings of the CMP are contained in a 

separate report (FCCC/KP/CMP/2015/8). The proceedings of the joint meetings of the COP and the 
CMP convened during the sessions are reproduced in both reports.

Rapporteur 

Mr. Georg Boersting (Norway) 

13.  At  the  10th  meeting,  the  President  informed  Parties  that  a  nominee  for  Vice-

developing  draft  decisions  and  conclusions  for  consideration  by  the  COP  before  the 
sessions of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) and the 
Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) ended on 4 December. He also noted that, given 
the challenges of time management during the session of the COP, it would not be possible 
to extend the sessions of the subsidiary bodies. He further noted that the Ad Hoc Working 
Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action (ADP) would submit the results of its 
work to the COP on 5 December. 

16.

19.  With  regard  to  agenda  item  20,  “High-level  segment”,  the  President  informed  the 
COP that the inauguration of the joint high-level segment of the COP and the CMP would 
take place on the morning of 7 December and that ministers and other heads of delegation 
would  deliver  national  statements  on  7  and  8  December.  As  per  established  practice,9  no

20. 
The President informed the COP that, to enable the COP and the CMP to adopt all 
draft decisions, including the outcomes of the ADP process, all negotiations would have to 
conclude  by  9  December.  This  would  ensure  that  document  processing,  translation  into 
other official United Nations languages and the requisite legal and linguistic reviews could 
be completed in time to ensure a timely and orderly closure of the conference. 

21. 
The  President  also  informed  the  COP  that  separate  meetings  of  the  COP  and  the 
CMP  would  be  held  on  10  December  so  that  decisions  and  conclusions,  including  those 
recommended  at  the  sessions  of  the  subsidiary  bodies,  could  be  adopted.  He  further 
informed the COP that the COP and the CMP would complete their work on 11 December, 
including  the  consideration  and  adoption  by  the  COP  of  the  outcomes  of  the  ADP 
negotiations.  

22. 
The  President  reminded  Parties  of  his  intent  to  ensure  a  Party-driven,  transparent 
and  inclusive  approach  with  proper  time  management,  including  beginning  meetings  on 
time,  ensuring  timely  closure  of  negotiations,  enforcing  agreed  working  practices  and 
ensuring that all meetings finish by 6 p.m. and only exceptionally by 9 p.m. He encouraged

Note: Data based on the most up-to-date amounts communicated by the Parties to the Convention 

in their national communications, greenhouse gas inventory reports, biennial reports or biennial 
update reports. Since the amounts communicated by the Parties to the Convention in many cases did 
not include data on emissions by source and removals by sinks from land use, land-use change and 
forestry, or, when included, these emissions by source and removals by sinks were estimated using 
different methodologies, these data were not included. Also, since the communicated amounts are for 
different years, the total amount provided in this table should be used solely for the limited purposes 
of Article 21 of the Paris Agreement as it does not represent an accurate estimate of global 
greenhouse gas emissions.

Union were 4,488,404 gigagrams in 2013, which represents the sum of the emissions of its member 
States in this table, and corresponds to 12.08 per cent of the total emissions in this table. The 
emissions of the European Union are not counted as additional to those of the member States.

twenty-first session

At  the  1st  meeting  of  the  COP,3  on  30  November,  the  President  of  COP  20, 
3. 
Mr. Pulgar-Vidal, recalled that, in accordance with rule 22, paragraph 1, of the draft rules 
of procedure being applied, the office of President of the COP is subject to rotation among 
the five regional groups. He informed Parties that a nomination had been received from the 
Western  European  and  other  States.  Following  his  proposal,  the  COP  elected  by 
acclamation  the  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs  and  International  Development  of  France, 
Mr. Laurent Fabius, as its President. A statement was made by the newly elected President.4 

B.  Adoption of the rules of procedure 

(Agenda sub-item 2(b)) 

At  the  2nd  meeting,  on  1  December,  the  President  recalled  that  the  President  of 
4. 
COP 20  had  proposed,  and  Parties  had  agreed,  that  he  would  conduct  intersessional 
consultations on this issue and inform the COP of any developments. As there continued to 
be  no  consensus  on  this  matter,  the  President  proposed  that,  as  at  previous  sessions,  the 
draft  rules  of  procedure  contained  in  document  FCCC/CP/1996/2  should  continue  to  be 
applied,  with  the  exception  of  draft  rule  42.  He  also  proposed  that  Mr.  Xavier  Sticker 
(France)  hold  informal  consultations  on  this  issue  and  report  back  to  the  COP  on  their 
outcome.  

At the 10th meeting, on 10 December, the President reported that there was still no 
5. 
consensus  on  this  issue.  On  a  proposal  by  the  President,  the  COP  agreed  to  continue  to 
apply  the  draft  rules  of  procedure  as  outlined  in  paragraph  4  above,  and  agreed  that  the 
President  would  continue  consultations  during  the  intersessional  period  and  would  report 
back at COP 22. 

1  COP 21 was held in conjunction with CMP 11. The proceedings of the CMP are contained in a 

separate report (FCCC/KP/CMP/2015/8). The proceedings of the joint meetings of the COP and the

Note: Data based on the most up-to-date amounts communicated by the Parties to the Convention 

in their national communications, greenhouse gas inventory reports, biennial reports or biennial 
update reports. Since the amounts communicated by the Parties to the Convention in many cases did 
not include data on emissions by source and removals by sinks from land use, land-use change and 
forestry, or, when included, these emissions by source and removals by sinks were estimated using 
different methodologies, these data were not included. Also, since the communicated amounts are for 
different years, the total amount provided in this table should be used solely for the limited purposes 
of Article 21 of the Paris Agreement as it does not represent an accurate estimate of global 
greenhouse gas emissions. 

a   Countries that are member States of the European Union. The emissions of the European 
Union were 4,488,404 gigagrams in 2013, which represents the sum of the emissions of its member 
States in this table, and corresponds to 12.08 per cent of the total emissions in this table. The 
emissions of the European Union are not counted as additional to those of the member States.

The twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties (COP), convened pursuant 
to  Article  7,  paragraph  4,  of  the  Convention,  was  opened  at  the  United  Nations  Climate 
Change  Conference,  Paris–Le  Bourget,  France,  on  30  November  2015  by  Mr.  Manuel 
Pulgar-Vidal  (Peru),  President  of  COP  20.1  Mr.  Pulgar-Vidal  delivered  an  opening 
statement. 

The opening included statements made by the Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC, 

2. 
Ms. Christiana Figueres, and His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales.2 

II.  Organizational matters 

(Agenda item 2) 

A.  Election of the President of the Conference of the Parties at its  

twenty-first session 
(Agenda sub-item 2(a)) 

At  the  1st  meeting  of  the  COP,3  on  30  November,  the  President  of  COP  20, 
3. 
Mr. Pulgar-Vidal, recalled that, in accordance with rule 22, paragraph 1, of the draft rules 
of procedure being applied, the office of President of the COP is subject to rotation among 
the five regional groups. He informed Parties that a nomination had been received from the 
Western  European  and  other  States.  Following  his  proposal,  the  COP  elected  by 
acclamation  the  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs  and  International  Development  of  France, 
Mr. Laurent Fabius, as its President. A statement was made by the newly elected President.4 

B.  Adoption of the rules of procedure 

(Agenda sub-item 2(b)) 

At  the  2nd  meeting,  on  1  December,  the  President  recalled  that  the  President  of 
4. 
COP 20  had  proposed,  and  Parties  had  agreed,  that  he  would  conduct  intersessional 
consultations on this issue and inform the COP of any developments. As there continued to 
be  no  consensus  on  this  matter,  the  President  proposed  that,  as  at  previous  sessions,  the 
draft  rules  of  procedure  contained  in  document  FCCC/CP/1996/2  should  continue  to  be 
applied,  with  the  exception  of  draft  rule  42.  He  also  proposed  that  Mr.  Xavier  Sticker 
(France)  hold  informal  consultations  on  this  issue  and  report  back  to  the  COP  on  their 
outcome.  

At the 10th meeting, on 10 December, the President reported that there was still no 
5. 
consensus  on  this  issue.  On  a  proposal  by  the  President,  the  COP  agreed  to  continue  to 
apply  the  draft  rules  of  procedure  as  outlined  in  paragraph  4  above,  and  agreed  that  the 
President  would  continue  consultations  during  the  intersessional  period  and  would  report 
back at COP 22. 

1  COP 21 was held in conjunction with CMP 11. The proceedings of the CMP are contained in a 

separate report (FCCC/KP/CMP/2015/8). The proceedings of the joint meetings of the COP and the 
CMP convened during the sessions are reproduced in both reports.

C.  Adoption of the agenda 
(Agenda sub-item 2(c)) 

At its 2nd meeting, the COP considered a note by the Executive Secretary containing

prepared in agreement with the President of COP 20, after consultation with the Bureau of 
the COP. 

7. 
The  President  proposed  that  the  provisional  agenda  be  adopted  as  contained  in 
document  FCCC/CP/2015/1,  with  the  exception  of  item  11,  “Second  review  of  the

Note: Data based on the most up-to-date amounts communicated by the Parties to the Convention 

in their national communications, greenhouse gas inventory reports, biennial reports or biennial 
update reports. Since the amounts communicated by the Parties to the Convention in many cases did 
not include data on emissions by source and removals by sinks from land use, land-use change and 
forestry, or, when included, these emissions by source and removals by sinks were estimated using 
different methodologies, these data were not included. Also, since the communicated amounts are for 
different years, the total amount provided in this table should be used solely for the limited purposes 
of Article 21 of the Paris Agreement as it does not represent an accurate estimate of global 
greenhouse gas emissions. 

a   Countries that are member States of the European Union. The emissions of the European 
Union were 4,488,404 gigagrams in 2013, which represents the sum of the emissions of its member 
States in this table, and corresponds to 12.08 per cent of the total emissions in this table. The 
emissions of the European Union are not counted as additional to those of the member States.

(Agenda item 1) 

1. 
The twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties (COP), convened pursuant 
to  Article  7,  paragraph  4,  of  the  Convention,  was  opened  at  the  United  Nations  Climate 
Change  Conference,  Paris–Le  Bourget,  France,  on  30  November  2015  by  Mr.  Manuel 
Pulgar-Vidal  (Peru),  President  of  COP  20.1  Mr.  Pulgar-Vidal  delivered  an  opening 
statement. 

The opening included statements made by the Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC, 

2. 
Ms. Christiana Figueres, and His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales.2 

II.  Organizational matters 

(Agenda item 2) 

A.  Election of the President of the Conference of the Parties at its  

twenty-first session 
(Agenda sub-item 2(a)) 

At  the  1st  meeting  of  the  COP,3  on  30  November,  the  President  of  COP  20, 
3. 
Mr. Pulgar-Vidal, recalled that, in accordance with rule 22, paragraph 1, of the draft rules 
of procedure being applied, the office of President of the COP is subject to rotation among 
the five regional groups. He informed Parties that a nomination had been received from the 
Western  European  and  other  States.  Following  his  proposal,  the  COP  elected  by 
acclamation  the  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs  and  International  Development  of  France, 
Mr. Laurent Fabius, as its President. A statement was made by the newly elected President.4 

B.  Adoption of the rules of procedure 

(Agenda sub-item 2(b)) 

At  the  2nd  meeting,  on  1  December,  the  President  recalled  that  the  President  of 
4. 
COP 20  had  proposed,  and  Parties  had  agreed,  that  he  would  conduct  intersessional 
consultations on this issue and inform the COP of any developments. As there continued to 
be  no  consensus  on  this  matter,  the  President  proposed  that,  as  at  previous  sessions,  the 
draft  rules  of  procedure  contained  in  document  FCCC/CP/1996/2  should  continue  to  be 
applied,  with  the  exception  of  draft  rule  42.  He  also  proposed  that  Mr.  Xavier  Sticker 
(France)  hold  informal  consultations  on  this  issue  and  report  back  to  the  COP  on  their 
outcome.  

At the 10th meeting, on 10 December, the President reported that there was still no 
5. 
consensus  on  this  issue.  On  a  proposal  by  the  President,  the  COP  agreed  to  continue  to 
apply  the  draft  rules  of  procedure  as  outlined  in  paragraph  4  above,  and  agreed  that  the 
President  would  continue  consultations  during  the  intersessional  period  and  would  report 
back at COP 22. 

1  COP 21 was held in conjunction with CMP 11. The proceedings of the CMP are contained in a 

separate report (FCCC/KP/CMP/2015/8). The proceedings of the joint meetings of the COP and the 
CMP convened during the sessions are reproduced in both reports.

prepared in agreement with the President of COP 20, after consultation with the Bureau of

The  President  proposed  that  the  provisional  agenda  be  adopted  as  contained  in 
document  FCCC/CP/2015/1,  with  the  exception  of  item  11,  “Second  review  of  the

Note: Data based on the most up-to-date amounts communicated by the Parties to the Convention 

in their national communications, greenhouse gas inventory reports, biennial reports or biennial 
update reports. Since the amounts communicated by the Parties to the Convention in many cases did 
not include data on emissions by source and removals by sinks from land use, land-use change and 
forestry, or, when included, these emissions by source and removals by sinks were estimated using 
different methodologies, these data were not included. Also, since the communicated amounts are for 
different years, the total amount provided in this table should be used solely for the limited purposes 
of Article 21 of the Paris Agreement as it does not represent an accurate estimate of global 
greenhouse gas emissions. 

a   Countries that are member States of the European Union. The emissions of the European 
Union were 4,488,404 gigagrams in 2013, which represents the sum of the emissions of its member 
States in this table, and corresponds to 12.08 per cent of the total emissions in this table. The 
emissions of the European Union are not counted as additional to those of the member States.
