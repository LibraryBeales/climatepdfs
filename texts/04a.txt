I.  Opening of the session 

(Agenda item 1) 

1. 
The tenth part of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban 
Platform  for  Enhanced  Action  (ADP)  was  held  at  the  World  Conference  Center  Bonn  in 
Bonn, Germany, from 31 August to 4 September 2015.1 

2. 
The  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP,  Mr.  Ahmed  Djoghlaf  (non-Annex  I)  and  Mr.  Daniel 
Reifsnyder (Annex I), resumed the second session of the ADP by opening its 19th plenary 
meeting  on  31  August  2015.  They  welcomed  all  Parties  and  observers  and  conveyed  the 
regret  of  the  Rapporteur  of  the  ADP,  Ms.  Yang  Liu  (non-Annex  I),  for  not  being  able  to 
attend the opening plenary owing to national commitments.2 

3. 
The  Co-Chairs  also  welcomed  the  Executive  Secretary,  Ms.  Christiana  Figueres, 
who  provided  delegates  with  information  on  the  status  of  funding  for  the  October  and 
December  sessions.  The  Executive  Secretary  reported  on  the  deficit  in  the  funding  for 
logistics and participation in the October ADP session and for participation in the twenty-
first  session  of  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  (COP)  and  the  eleventh  session  of  the 
Conference  of  the  Parties  serving  as  the  meeting  of  the  Parties  to  the  Kyoto  Protocol 
(CMP), to be held in November–December 2015. She urged Parties in a position to do so to 
communicate their contributions to the secretariat within the course of the week. 

Several Parties expressed concern about the secretariat’s lack of resources to finance 

4. 
an additional delegate for the current session. 

In order to advance the mandates and timelines agreed on at COP 17,3 18,4 195 and 
5. 
20,6 the Co-Chairs identified the objectives of the tenth part of the second session, namely 
to  produce  a  clearer  understanding  and  articulation  of  the  elements  of  the  Paris  climate 
package  by  identifying  areas  of  convergence  in  conceptual  and  if  possible  textual  form, 
resolving  diverging  views  through  the  development  of  proposals  that  bridge  two  or  more 
options in the text and developing a coherent description of how the outcome of the ADP 
will address the relevant thematic area.7 

6. 
Statements  were  made  by  representatives  of  12  Parties,  including  on  behalf  of  the 
Group of 77 and China, the European Union and its 28 member States, the Environmental 
Integrity Group, the African Group, the Alliance of Small Island States, the League of Arab 
States, the Independent Association for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Coalition for 
Rainforest  Nations,  the  Like-minded  Developing  Countries,  the  BASIC  countries  (Brazil, 
China,  India  and  South  Africa),  the  Central  American  Integration  System  and  Indonesia.

I.  Opening of the session 

(Agenda item 1) 

1. 
The tenth part of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban 
Platform  for  Enhanced  Action  (ADP)  was  held  at  the  World  Conference  Center  Bonn  in 
Bonn, Germany, from 31 August to 4 September 2015.1 

2. 
The  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP,  Mr.  Ahmed  Djoghlaf  (non-Annex  I)  and  Mr.  Daniel 
Reifsnyder (Annex I), resumed the second session of the ADP by opening its 19th plenary 
meeting  on  31  August  2015.  They  welcomed  all  Parties  and  observers  and  conveyed  the 
regret  of  the  Rapporteur  of  the  ADP,  Ms.  Yang  Liu  (non-Annex  I),  for  not  being  able  to 
attend the opening plenary owing to national commitments.2 

3. 
The  Co-Chairs  also  welcomed  the  Executive  Secretary,  Ms.  Christiana  Figueres, 
who  provided  delegates  with  information  on  the  status  of  funding  for  the  October  and 
December  sessions.  The  Executive  Secretary  reported  on  the  deficit  in  the  funding  for 
logistics and participation in the October ADP session and for participation in the twenty-
first  session  of  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  (COP)  and  the  eleventh  session  of  the 
Conference  of  the  Parties  serving  as  the  meeting  of  the  Parties  to  the  Kyoto  Protocol 
(CMP), to be held in November–December 2015. She urged Parties in a position to do so to 
communicate their contributions to the secretariat within the course of the week. 

Several Parties expressed concern about the secretariat’s lack of resources to finance 

4. 
an additional delegate for the current session. 

In order to advance the mandates and timelines agreed on at COP 17,3 18,4 195 and 
5. 
20,6 the Co-Chairs identified the objectives of the tenth part of the second session, namely 
to  produce  a  clearer  understanding  and  articulation  of  the  elements  of  the  Paris  climate 
package  by  identifying  areas  of  convergence  in  conceptual  and  if  possible  textual  form, 
resolving  diverging  views  through  the  development  of  proposals  that  bridge  two  or  more 
options in the text and developing a coherent description of how the outcome of the ADP 
will address the relevant thematic area.7 

6. 
Statements  were  made  by  representatives  of  12  Parties,  including  on  behalf  of  the 
Group of 77 and China, the European Union and its 28 member States, the Environmental 
Integrity Group, the African Group, the Alliance of Small Island States, the League of Arab 
States, the Independent Association for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Coalition for 
Rainforest  Nations,  the  Like-minded  Developing  Countries,  the  BASIC  countries  (Brazil, 
China,  India  and  South  Africa),  the  Central  American  Integration  System  and  Indonesia.

I.  Opening of the session 

(Agenda item 1) 

1. 
The tenth part of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban 
Platform  for  Enhanced  Action  (ADP)  was  held  at  the  World  Conference  Center  Bonn  in 
Bonn, Germany, from 31 August to 4 September 2015.1 

2. 
The  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP,  Mr.  Ahmed  Djoghlaf  (non-Annex  I)  and  Mr.  Daniel 
Reifsnyder (Annex I), resumed the second session of the ADP by opening its 19th plenary 
meeting  on  31  August  2015.  They  welcomed  all  Parties  and  observers  and  conveyed  the 
regret  of  the  Rapporteur  of  the  ADP,  Ms.  Yang  Liu  (non-Annex  I),  for  not  being  able  to 
attend the opening plenary owing to national commitments.2 

3. 
The  Co-Chairs  also  welcomed  the  Executive  Secretary,  Ms.  Christiana  Figueres, 
who  provided  delegates  with  information  on  the  status  of  funding  for  the  October  and 
December  sessions.  The  Executive  Secretary  reported  on  the  deficit  in  the  funding  for 
logistics and participation in the October ADP session and for participation in the twenty-
first  session  of  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  (COP)  and  the  eleventh  session  of  the 
Conference  of  the  Parties  serving  as  the  meeting  of  the  Parties  to  the  Kyoto  Protocol 
(CMP), to be held in November–December 2015. She urged Parties in a position to do so to 
communicate their contributions to the secretariat within the course of the week. 

Several Parties expressed concern about the secretariat’s lack of resources to finance 

4. 
an additional delegate for the current session. 

In order to advance the mandates and timelines agreed on at COP 17,3 18,4 195 and 
5. 
20,6 the Co-Chairs identified the objectives of the tenth part of the second session, namely 
to  produce  a  clearer  understanding  and  articulation  of  the  elements  of  the  Paris  climate 
package  by  identifying  areas  of  convergence  in  conceptual  and  if  possible  textual  form, 
resolving  diverging  views  through  the  development  of  proposals  that  bridge  two  or  more 
options in the text and developing a coherent description of how the outcome of the ADP 
will address the relevant thematic area.7 

6. 
Statements  were  made  by  representatives  of  12  Parties,  including  on  behalf  of  the 
Group of 77 and China, the European Union and its 28 member States, the Environmental 
Integrity Group, the African Group, the Alliance of Small Island States, the League of Arab 
States, the Independent Association for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Coalition for 
Rainforest  Nations,  the  Like-minded  Developing  Countries,  the  BASIC  countries  (Brazil, 
China,  India  and  South  Africa),  the  Central  American  Integration  System  and  Indonesia. 

1  The report on the first and second parts of the second session of the ADP is contained in document 

FCCC/ADP/2013/2; the reports on the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth parts of the 
second session are contained in documents FCCC/ADP/2013/3, FCCC/ADP/2014/1,

FCCC/ADP/2015/3, respectively. 

2  The Bureau of the ADP was elected in accordance with the arrangement set out in document 

FCCC/ADP/2012/2, paragraph 7, which was endorsed by decision 2/CP.18. The ADP elected the 
current members of its Bureau at the seventh part of its second session, as reflected in document

7. 
and the incoming Presidency of COP 21/CMP 11 to inform delegates of initiatives already 
undertaken to help to ensure the success of COP 21/CMP 11. Representatives of Peru and

daily basis on the UNFCCC website.18 The final version of the working document was also 
made available on the UNFCCC website.19 

14. 
Parties exchanged views in facilitated meetings on workstream 2, including on  how

mode of work, including an open-ended drafting committee chaired by the Co-Chairs, from

I.  Opening of the session 

(Agenda item 1) 

1. 
The tenth part of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban 
Platform  for  Enhanced  Action  (ADP)  was  held  at  the  World  Conference  Center  Bonn  in 
Bonn, Germany, from 31 August to 4 September 2015.1 

2. 
The  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP,  Mr.  Ahmed  Djoghlaf  (non-Annex  I)  and  Mr.  Daniel 
Reifsnyder (Annex I), resumed the second session of the ADP by opening its 19th plenary 
meeting  on  31  August  2015.  They  welcomed  all  Parties  and  observers  and  conveyed  the 
regret  of  the  Rapporteur  of  the  ADP,  Ms.  Yang  Liu  (non-Annex  I),  for  not  being  able  to 
attend the opening plenary owing to national commitments.2 

3. 
The  Co-Chairs  also  welcomed  the  Executive  Secretary,  Ms.  Christiana  Figueres, 
who  provided  delegates  with  information  on  the  status  of  funding  for  the  October  and 
December  sessions.  The  Executive  Secretary  reported  on  the  deficit  in  the  funding  for 
logistics and participation in the October ADP session and for participation in the twenty-
first  session  of  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  (COP)  and  the  eleventh  session  of  the 
Conference  of  the  Parties  serving  as  the  meeting  of  the  Parties  to  the  Kyoto  Protocol 
(CMP), to be held in November–December 2015. She urged Parties in a position to do so to 
communicate their contributions to the secretariat within the course of the week. 

Several Parties expressed concern about the secretariat’s lack of resources to finance 

4. 
an additional delegate for the current session. 

In order to advance the mandates and timelines agreed on at COP 17,3 18,4 195 and 
5. 
20,6 the Co-Chairs identified the objectives of the tenth part of the second session, namely 
to  produce  a  clearer  understanding  and  articulation  of  the  elements  of  the  Paris  climate 
package  by  identifying  areas  of  convergence  in  conceptual  and  if  possible  textual  form, 
resolving  diverging  views  through  the  development  of  proposals  that  bridge  two  or  more 
options in the text and developing a coherent description of how the outcome of the ADP 
will address the relevant thematic area.7 

6. 
Statements  were  made  by  representatives  of  12  Parties,  including  on  behalf  of  the 
Group of 77 and China, the European Union and its 28 member States, the Environmental 
Integrity Group, the African Group, the Alliance of Small Island States, the League of Arab 
States, the Independent Association for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Coalition for 
Rainforest  Nations,  the  Like-minded  Developing  Countries,  the  BASIC  countries  (Brazil, 
China,  India  and  South  Africa),  the  Central  American  Integration  System  and  Indonesia.

I.  Opening of the session 

(Agenda item 1) 

1. 
The tenth part of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban 
Platform  for  Enhanced  Action  (ADP)  was  held  at  the  World  Conference  Center  Bonn  in 
Bonn, Germany, from 31 August to 4 September 2015.1 

2. 
The  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP,  Mr.  Ahmed  Djoghlaf  (non-Annex  I)  and  Mr.  Daniel 
Reifsnyder (Annex I), resumed the second session of the ADP by opening its 19th plenary 
meeting  on  31  August  2015.  They  welcomed  all  Parties  and  observers  and  conveyed  the 
regret  of  the  Rapporteur  of  the  ADP,  Ms.  Yang  Liu  (non-Annex  I),  for  not  being  able  to 
attend the opening plenary owing to national commitments.2 

3. 
The  Co-Chairs  also  welcomed  the  Executive  Secretary,  Ms.  Christiana  Figueres, 
who  provided  delegates  with  information  on  the  status  of  funding  for  the  October  and 
December  sessions.  The  Executive  Secretary  reported  on  the  deficit  in  the  funding  for 
logistics and participation in the October ADP session and for participation in the twenty-
first  session  of  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  (COP)  and  the  eleventh  session  of  the 
Conference  of  the  Parties  serving  as  the  meeting  of  the  Parties  to  the  Kyoto  Protocol 
(CMP), to be held in November–December 2015. She urged Parties in a position to do so to 
communicate their contributions to the secretariat within the course of the week. 

Several Parties expressed concern about the secretariat’s lack of resources to finance 

4. 
an additional delegate for the current session. 

In order to advance the mandates and timelines agreed on at COP 17,3 18,4 195 and 
5. 
20,6 the Co-Chairs identified the objectives of the tenth part of the second session, namely 
to  produce  a  clearer  understanding  and  articulation  of  the  elements  of  the  Paris  climate 
package  by  identifying  areas  of  convergence  in  conceptual  and  if  possible  textual  form, 
resolving  diverging  views  through  the  development  of  proposals  that  bridge  two  or  more 
options in the text and developing a coherent description of how the outcome of the ADP 
will address the relevant thematic area.7 

6. 
Statements  were  made  by  representatives  of  12  Parties,  including  on  behalf  of  the 
Group of 77 and China, the European Union and its 28 member States, the Environmental 
Integrity Group, the African Group, the Alliance of Small Island States, the League of Arab 
States, the Independent Association for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Coalition for 
Rainforest  Nations,  the  Like-minded  Developing  Countries,  the  BASIC  countries  (Brazil, 
China,  India  and  South  Africa),  the  Central  American  Integration  System  and  Indonesia.

I.  Opening of the session 

(Agenda item 1) 

1. 
The tenth part of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban 
Platform  for  Enhanced  Action  (ADP)  was  held  at  the  World  Conference  Center  Bonn  in 
Bonn, Germany, from 31 August to 4 September 2015.1 

2. 
The  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP,  Mr.  Ahmed  Djoghlaf  (non-Annex  I)  and  Mr.  Daniel 
Reifsnyder (Annex I), resumed the second session of the ADP by opening its 19th plenary 
meeting  on  31  August  2015.  They  welcomed  all  Parties  and  observers  and  conveyed  the 
regret  of  the  Rapporteur  of  the  ADP,  Ms.  Yang  Liu  (non-Annex  I),  for  not  being  able  to 
attend the opening plenary owing to national commitments.2 

3. 
The  Co-Chairs  also  welcomed  the  Executive  Secretary,  Ms.  Christiana  Figueres, 
who  provided  delegates  with  information  on  the  status  of  funding  for  the  October  and 
December  sessions.  The  Executive  Secretary  reported  on  the  deficit  in  the  funding  for 
logistics and participation in the October ADP session and for participation in the twenty-
first  session  of  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  (COP)  and  the  eleventh  session  of  the 
Conference  of  the  Parties  serving  as  the  meeting  of  the  Parties  to  the  Kyoto  Protocol 
(CMP), to be held in November–December 2015. She urged Parties in a position to do so to 
communicate their contributions to the secretariat within the course of the week. 

Several Parties expressed concern about the secretariat’s lack of resources to finance 

4. 
an additional delegate for the current session. 

In order to advance the mandates and timelines agreed on at COP 17,3 18,4 195 and 
5. 
20,6 the Co-Chairs identified the objectives of the tenth part of the second session, namely 
to  produce  a  clearer  understanding  and  articulation  of  the  elements  of  the  Paris  climate 
package  by  identifying  areas  of  convergence  in  conceptual  and  if  possible  textual  form, 
resolving  diverging  views  through  the  development  of  proposals  that  bridge  two  or  more 
options in the text and developing a coherent description of how the outcome of the ADP 
will address the relevant thematic area.7 

6. 
Statements  were  made  by  representatives  of  12  Parties,  including  on  behalf  of  the 
Group of 77 and China, the European Union and its 28 member States, the Environmental 
Integrity Group, the African Group, the Alliance of Small Island States, the League of Arab 
States, the Independent Association for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Coalition for 
Rainforest  Nations,  the  Like-minded  Developing  Countries,  the  BASIC  countries  (Brazil, 
China,  India  and  South  Africa),  the  Central  American  Integration  System  and  Indonesia. 

1  The report on the first and second parts of the second session of the ADP is contained in document 

FCCC/ADP/2013/2; the reports on the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth parts of the 
second session are contained in documents FCCC/ADP/2013/3, FCCC/ADP/2014/1,

FCCC/ADP/2015/3, respectively. 

2  The Bureau of the ADP was elected in accordance with the arrangement set out in document 

FCCC/ADP/2012/2, paragraph 7, which was endorsed by decision 2/CP.18. The ADP elected the 
current members of its Bureau at the seventh part of its second session, as reflected in document 
FCCC/ADP/2014/4.

7. 
and the incoming Presidency of COP 21/CMP 11 to inform delegates of initiatives already 
undertaken to help to ensure the success of COP 21/CMP 11. Representatives of Peru and 
France made statements on the informal ministerial consultations held in Paris, France, on

facilitated meetings were captured in a working document and made publicly available on a 
daily basis on the UNFCCC website.18 The final version of the working document was also 
made available on the UNFCCC website.19 

14. 
Parties exchanged views in facilitated meetings on workstream 2, including on  how 
to  further  advance  pre-2020  climate  action.  The  output  of  these  meetings  has  also  been 
posted on the UNFCCC website.20 

15.  On  2  September,  the  ADP  took  stock  of  the  progress  of  work.  The  Co-Chairs

and 2, based on the Geneva negotiating text22 and taking  fully  into account the views and 
positions  expressed  by  Parties  on  the  Co-Chairs’  tool23  at  the  tenth  part  of  the  session.  A 
clear,  concise  and  comprehensive  document  and  accompanying  scenario  note  would  be 
made  available  in  the  first  week  of  October.  The  scenario  note  would  indicate  the  new 
mode of work, including an open-ended drafting committee chaired by the Co-Chairs, from 
which spin-off groups, to be moderated by the co-facilitators, would be launched.

the session, the Co-Chairs invited the secretariat to provide delegates with an update on the

informed Parties that, thanks to the generosity of several contributors, the required funding 
to  cover  the  full  organizational  costs  and  to  ensure  the  adequate  participation  of 
representatives  of  eligible  developing  countries  in  the  October  session  and  COP  21  had 
been pledged.

attend the opening plenary owing to national commitments.2 

3. 
The  Co-Chairs  also  welcomed  the  Executive  Secretary,  Ms.  Christiana  Figueres,

first  session  of  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  (COP)  and  the  eleventh  session  of  the 
Conference  of  the  Parties  serving  as  the  meeting  of  the  Parties  to  the  Kyoto  Protocol

20,6 the Co-Chairs identified the objectives of the tenth part of the second session, namely 
to  produce  a  clearer  understanding  and  articulation  of  the  elements  of  the  Paris  climate 
package  by  identifying  areas  of  convergence  in  conceptual  and  if  possible  textual  form, 
resolving  diverging  views  through  the  development  of  proposals  that  bridge  two  or  more 
options in the text and developing a coherent description of how the outcome of the ADP 
will address the relevant thematic area.7 

6. 
Statements  were  made  by  representatives  of  12  Parties,  including  on  behalf  of  the 
Group of 77 and China, the European Union and its 28 member States, the Environmental

I.  Opening of the session 

(Agenda item 1) 

1. 
The tenth part of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban 
Platform  for  Enhanced  Action  (ADP)  was  held  at  the  World  Conference  Center  Bonn  in 
Bonn, Germany, from 31 August to 4 September 2015.1 

2. 
The  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP,  Mr.  Ahmed  Djoghlaf  (non-Annex  I)  and  Mr.  Daniel 
Reifsnyder (Annex I), resumed the second session of the ADP by opening its 19th plenary 
meeting  on  31  August  2015.  They  welcomed  all  Parties  and  observers  and  conveyed  the 
regret  of  the  Rapporteur  of  the  ADP,  Ms.  Yang  Liu  (non-Annex  I),  for  not  being  able  to 
attend the opening plenary owing to national commitments.2 

3. 
The  Co-Chairs  also  welcomed  the  Executive  Secretary,  Ms.  Christiana  Figueres, 
who  provided  delegates  with  information  on  the  status  of  funding  for  the  October  and 
December  sessions.  The  Executive  Secretary  reported  on  the  deficit  in  the  funding  for 
logistics and participation in the October ADP session and for participation in the twenty-
first  session  of  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  (COP)  and  the  eleventh  session  of  the 
Conference  of  the  Parties  serving  as  the  meeting  of  the  Parties  to  the  Kyoto  Protocol 
(CMP), to be held in November–December 2015. She urged Parties in a position to do so to 
communicate their contributions to the secretariat within the course of the week. 

Several Parties expressed concern about the secretariat’s lack of resources to finance 

4. 
an additional delegate for the current session. 

In order to advance the mandates and timelines agreed on at COP 17,3 18,4 195 and 
5. 
20,6 the Co-Chairs identified the objectives of the tenth part of the second session, namely 
to  produce  a  clearer  understanding  and  articulation  of  the  elements  of  the  Paris  climate 
package  by  identifying  areas  of  convergence  in  conceptual  and  if  possible  textual  form, 
resolving  diverging  views  through  the  development  of  proposals  that  bridge  two  or  more 
options in the text and developing a coherent description of how the outcome of the ADP 
will address the relevant thematic area.7 

6. 
Statements  were  made  by  representatives  of  12  Parties,  including  on  behalf  of  the 
Group of 77 and China, the European Union and its 28 member States, the Environmental 
Integrity Group, the African Group, the Alliance of Small Island States, the League of Arab 
States, the Independent Association for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Coalition for 
Rainforest  Nations,  the  Like-minded  Developing  Countries,  the  BASIC  countries  (Brazil, 
China,  India  and  South  Africa),  the  Central  American  Integration  System  and  Indonesia.

2  The Bureau of the ADP was elected in accordance with the arrangement set out in document 

FCCC/ADP/2012/2, paragraph 7, which was endorsed by decision 2/CP.18. The ADP elected the 
current members of its Bureau at the seventh part of its second session, as reflected in document

undertaken to help to ensure the success of COP 21/CMP 11. Representatives of Peru and

I.  Opening of the session 

(Agenda item 1) 

1. 
The tenth part of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban 
Platform  for  Enhanced  Action  (ADP)  was  held  at  the  World  Conference  Center  Bonn  in 
Bonn, Germany, from 31 August to 4 September 2015.1 

2. 
The  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP,  Mr.  Ahmed  Djoghlaf  (non-Annex  I)  and  Mr.  Daniel 
Reifsnyder (Annex I), resumed the second session of the ADP by opening its 19th plenary 
meeting  on  31  August  2015.  They  welcomed  all  Parties  and  observers  and  conveyed  the 
regret  of  the  Rapporteur  of  the  ADP,  Ms.  Yang  Liu  (non-Annex  I),  for  not  being  able  to 
attend the opening plenary owing to national commitments.2 

3. 
The  Co-Chairs  also  welcomed  the  Executive  Secretary,  Ms.  Christiana  Figueres, 
who  provided  delegates  with  information  on  the  status  of  funding  for  the  October  and 
December  sessions.  The  Executive  Secretary  reported  on  the  deficit  in  the  funding  for 
logistics and participation in the October ADP session and for participation in the twenty-
first  session  of  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  (COP)  and  the  eleventh  session  of  the 
Conference  of  the  Parties  serving  as  the  meeting  of  the  Parties  to  the  Kyoto  Protocol 
(CMP), to be held in November–December 2015. She urged Parties in a position to do so to 
communicate their contributions to the secretariat within the course of the week. 

Several Parties expressed concern about the secretariat’s lack of resources to finance 

4. 
an additional delegate for the current session. 

In order to advance the mandates and timelines agreed on at COP 17,3 18,4 195 and 
5. 
20,6 the Co-Chairs identified the objectives of the tenth part of the second session, namely 
to  produce  a  clearer  understanding  and  articulation  of  the  elements  of  the  Paris  climate 
package  by  identifying  areas  of  convergence  in  conceptual  and  if  possible  textual  form, 
resolving  diverging  views  through  the  development  of  proposals  that  bridge  two  or  more 
options in the text and developing a coherent description of how the outcome of the ADP 
will address the relevant thematic area.7 

6. 
Statements  were  made  by  representatives  of  12  Parties,  including  on  behalf  of  the 
Group of 77 and China, the European Union and its 28 member States, the Environmental 
Integrity Group, the African Group, the Alliance of Small Island States, the League of Arab 
States, the Independent Association for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Coalition for 
Rainforest  Nations,  the  Like-minded  Developing  Countries,  the  BASIC  countries  (Brazil, 
China,  India  and  South  Africa),  the  Central  American  Integration  System  and  Indonesia. 

1  The report on the first and second parts of the second session of the ADP is contained in document 

FCCC/ADP/2013/2; the reports on the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth parts of the

2  The Bureau of the ADP was elected in accordance with the arrangement set out in document 

FCCC/ADP/2012/2, paragraph 7, which was endorsed by decision 2/CP.18. The ADP elected the 
current members of its Bureau at the seventh part of its second session, as reflected in document

daily basis on the UNFCCC website.18 The final version of the working document was also 
made available on the UNFCCC website.19 

14. 
Parties exchanged views in facilitated meetings on workstream 2, including on  how 
to  further  advance  pre-2020  climate  action.  The  output  of  these  meetings  has  also  been 
posted on the UNFCCC website.20

positions  expressed  by  Parties  on  the  Co-Chairs’  tool23  at  the  tenth  part  of  the  session.  A 
clear,  concise  and  comprehensive  document  and  accompanying  scenario  note  would  be 
made  available  in  the  first  week  of  October.  The  scenario  note  would  indicate  the  new 
mode of work, including an open-ended drafting committee chaired by the Co-Chairs, from

Following  34  bilateral  meetings  and  the  meeting  with  the  heads  of  delegations 
referred to in paragraph 16 above, the Co-Chairs were unanimously requested by Parties to 
prepare, with the assistance of the co-facilitators and the support of the secretariat, a non-
paper containing a basis of negotiation for the draft Paris climate package on workstreams 1 
and 2, based on the Geneva negotiating text22 and taking  fully  into account the views and 
positions  expressed  by  Parties  on  the  Co-Chairs’  tool23  at  the  tenth  part  of  the  session.  A 
clear,  concise  and  comprehensive  document  and  accompanying  scenario  note  would  be 
made  available  in  the  first  week  of  October.  The  scenario  note  would  indicate  the  new 
mode of work, including an open-ended drafting committee chaired by the Co-Chairs, from 
which spin-off groups, to be moderated by the co-facilitators, would be launched.
