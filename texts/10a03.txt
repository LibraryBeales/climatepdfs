  Alternative policy approaches, such as joint mitigation and 
adaptation approaches for the integral and sustainable 
management of forests 

The Conference of the Parties, 

Recalling decisions 2/CP.17, paragraph 67, and 1/CP.18, paragraph 39, 

Notes  that  methodological  aspects  related  to  non-market-based  approaches  as 
1. 
referred to in decision 1/CP.18, paragraph 39, have been addressed by decisions 9/CP.19 to 
15/CP.19;

sustainability  of  the  implementation  of  the  activities  referred  to  in  decision  1/CP.16, 
paragraph 70, recognized in decision 9/CP.19, paragraph 22, 

Recognizing that multiple non-carbon benefits associated with the activities referred 

to in decision 1/CP.16, paragraph 70, can contribute to adaptation,  

1. 
Recognizes  that  non-carbon  benefits  associated  with  the  activities  referred  to  in 
decision  1/CP.16,  paragraph  70,  are  unique  to  countriesâ€™  national  circumstances,  in 
accordance with national sovereignty, legislation, policies and priorities; 

2. 
Also  recognizes  that,  in  line  with  their  national  circumstances  and  capabilities, 
developing country Parties seeking support for the integration of non-carbon benefits into 
activities referred to in decision 1/CP.16, paragraph 70, with a view to contributing to the 
long-term sustainability of those activities, may provide information addressing, inter alia, 
the nature, scale and importance of the non-carbon benefits;

3. 
paragraph 2 above via the web platform on the UNFCCC website;1  

4. 
Invites  interested  developing  country  Parties  to  communicate  the  information 
referred  to  in  paragraph  2  above  for  consideration  by  interested  Parties  and  relevant 
financing entities, as appropriate; 

5. 
Decides that methodological issues related to non-carbon benefits resulting from the 
implementation  of  the  activities  referred  to  in  decision  1/CP.16,  paragraph  70,  do  not 
constitute a requirement  for developing country Parties  seeking to receive support for the 
implementation of the actions and activities referred to in decision 1/CP.16 or results-based 
payments pursuant to decision 9/CP.19; 

6. 
Agrees to conclude at this session the work on methodological issues related to non-
carbon  benefits  from  the  implementation  of  the  activities  referred  to  in  decision  1/CP.16, 
paragraph 70.

the greenhouse gas inventories for Annex I Parties for the years 2015 and 2016 shall not be 
precedent-setting for future work;  

4. 
Requests  the  secretariat  to  make  every  effort  to  facilitate  future  reviews  in 
accordance  with  decision  13/CP.20  and  any  subsequent  relevant  decisions,  without 
exception;

concerning identical information in both yearsâ€™ inventories; 

3. 
Also decides that the exceptional measures taken under paragraph 1 above to review 
the greenhouse gas inventories for Annex I Parties for the years 2015 and 2016 shall not be 
precedent-setting for future work;  

4. 
Requests  the  secretariat  to  make  every  effort  to  facilitate  future  reviews  in 
accordance  with  decision  13/CP.20  and  any  subsequent  relevant  decisions,  without 
exception; 

5.

concerning identical information in both yearsâ€™ inventories; 

3. 
Also decides that the exceptional measures taken under paragraph 1 above to review 
the greenhouse gas inventories for Annex I Parties for the years 2015 and 2016 shall not be 
precedent-setting for future work;  

4. 
Requests  the  secretariat  to  make  every  effort  to  facilitate  future  reviews  in 
accordance  with  decision  13/CP.20  and  any  subsequent  relevant  decisions,  without 
exception; 

5.

Decision 20/CP.21 

  Technical review in 2016 of greenhouse gas inventories from 

Parties included in Annex I to the Convention 

The Conference of the Parties, 

Recalling decisions 12/CP.9, 24/CP.19 and 13/CP.20, 

Emphasizing  the  importance  of  ensuring  that  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  has 
adequate  and  reliable  information  on  annual  greenhouse  gas  inventories  from  Parties 
included in Annex I to the Convention (Annex I Parties), 

Recognizing that owing to a delay in the availability of a functioning CRF Reporter, 
not all Annex I Parties were able to submit their 2015 greenhouse gas inventories in time to 
start the review process of those inventories in 2015, 

1. 
Requests  the  secretariat  to  organize,  for  Parties  included  in  Annex  I  to  the 
Convention (Annex I Parties) that did not undergo a review of their annual greenhouse gas 
inventory in 2015, the review of their 2015 greenhouse gas inventory submission under the 
Convention  in  conjunction  with  the  review  of  their  2016  greenhouse  gas  inventory 
submission, ensuring that the reviews are organized in accordance with decision 13/CP.20; 

2. 
Decides that  the expert review teams shall review identical information only once, 
and that the expert review teams shall produce a separate, complete review report for each 
Party  for  each  year,  but  may  replicate  the  same  review  text  in  both  review  reports 
concerning identical information in both yearsâ€™ inventories; 

3. 
Also decides that the exceptional measures taken under paragraph 1 above to review 
the greenhouse gas inventories for Annex I Parties for the years 2015 and 2016 shall not be 
precedent-setting for future work;  

4. 
Requests  the  secretariat  to  make  every  effort  to  facilitate  future  reviews  in 
accordance  with  decision  13/CP.20  and  any  subsequent  relevant  decisions,  without 
exception; 

5. 
Also requests the secretariat to continue to make improvements to the CRF Reporter 
functionality,  prioritizing  the  resolution  of  outstanding  issues  related  to  transparency  and 
accuracy, noting that the CRF Reporter is not yet fully functioning.

the greenhouse gas inventories for Annex I Parties for the years 2015 and 2016 shall not be 
precedent-setting for future work;  

4. 
Requests  the  secretariat  to  make  every  effort  to  facilitate  future  reviews  in 
accordance  with  decision  13/CP.20  and  any  subsequent  relevant  decisions,  without 
exception;

Parties included in Annex I to the Convention 

The Conference of the Parties, 

Recalling decisions 12/CP.9, 24/CP.19 and 13/CP.20, 

Emphasizing  the  importance  of  ensuring  that  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  has 
adequate  and  reliable  information  on  annual  greenhouse  gas  inventories  from  Parties 
included in Annex I to the Convention (Annex I Parties), 

Recognizing that owing to a delay in the availability of a functioning CRF Reporter, 
not all Annex I Parties were able to submit their 2015 greenhouse gas inventories in time to 
start the review process of those inventories in 2015, 

1. 
Requests  the  secretariat  to  organize,  for  Parties  included  in  Annex  I  to  the 
Convention (Annex I Parties) that did not undergo a review of their annual greenhouse gas 
inventory in 2015, the review of their 2015 greenhouse gas inventory submission under the 
Convention  in  conjunction  with  the  review  of  their  2016  greenhouse  gas  inventory 
submission, ensuring that the reviews are organized in accordance with decision 13/CP.20; 

2. 
Decides that  the expert review teams shall review identical information only once, 
and that the expert review teams shall produce a separate, complete review report for each 
Party  for  each  year,  but  may  replicate  the  same  review  text  in  both  review  reports 
concerning identical information in both yearsâ€™ inventories; 

3. 
Also decides that the exceptional measures taken under paragraph 1 above to review 
the greenhouse gas inventories for Annex I Parties for the years 2015 and 2016 shall not be 
precedent-setting for future work;  

4. 
Requests  the  secretariat  to  make  every  effort  to  facilitate  future  reviews  in 
accordance  with  decision  13/CP.20  and  any  subsequent  relevant  decisions,  without 
exception; 

5. 
Also requests the secretariat to continue to make improvements to the CRF Reporter 
functionality,  prioritizing  the  resolution  of  outstanding  issues  related  to  transparency  and 
accuracy, noting that the CRF Reporter is not yet fully functioning.
