version  on  the  UNFCCC  website.  The  final  version  of  the  working  document  was  also 
made available on the UNFCCC website.21 

13. 
In the context of work on workstream 2, including on how to further advance pre-
2020  climate  action,  a  technical  paper  containing  the  updated  compilation  of  information 
on mitigation benefits of actions, initiatives and options to enhance mitigation ambition and 
its  addenda  on  renewable  energy  supply  and  energy  efficiency  in  urban  environments22

twelfth part of the session, Parties also requested that the Co-Chairs task the secretariat with 
preparing  a  technical  paper.25  This  paper  was  to  identify  closely  related  paragraphs  and 
duplications within sections, as well as possible areas for streamlining. Parties clearly stated 
that this paper be restricted to an editorial exercise to clean up the text without changing its 
content. 

17.  Closing statements were made on behalf of the Presidency of COP 20/CMP 10 and 
the  incoming  Presidency  of  COP  21/CMP  11.  In  addition,  one  Party  made  a  statement

mentioned non-paper, as well as to  the scenario note prepared for the  eleventh part of the 
session11  and  a  document  entitled  “Further  clarification  on  the  mode  of  work  of  the 
session”.12 This clarification was prepared by the Co-Chairs following their extensive pre-
sessional  consultations  with  Parties.  The  organization  of  the  work  on  agenda  item  3  as 
clarified  by  the  Co-Chairs  included  a  contact  group  established  at  the  fourth  part  of  the 
session13 and spin-off group meetings on specific articles of the Co-Chairs’ non-paper. The 
ADP proceeded on the basis of this proposal. 

In addition, the Co-Chairs informed Parties of their intention to hold a special event

8  above,  namely  the  Co-Chairs’  non-paper  containing  the  draft  agreement  and  draft 
decision, the draft decision on workstream 2 of the ADP, the scenario note prepared for the 
eleventh part of the session and a document containing further clarification on the mode of 
work of the session, as well as a note on the agreed mode of work at ADP 2.1116 and the 
report of the ADP on the tenth part of its second session.17 

Throughout the session, Party inputs to the negotiations18 as well as the work of the 
12. 
spin-off group meetings were captured and made publicly available daily on the UNFCCC 
website.19 Two versions of the draft agreement and draft decision were published on 20 and 
23 October.20 The version of 23 October was also made available as  an advance unedited 
version  on  the  UNFCCC  website.  The  final  version  of  the  working  document  was  also 
made available on the UNFCCC website.21 

13. 
In the context of work on workstream 2, including on how to further advance pre-
2020  climate  action,  a  technical  paper  containing  the  updated  compilation  of  information 
on mitigation benefits of actions, initiatives and options to enhance mitigation ambition and 
its  addenda  on  renewable  energy  supply  and  energy  efficiency  in  urban  environments22 
were  made  available  on  16  October.  During  the  session,  Parties  exchanged  views  on 
workstream 2 in spin-off group meetings. The output of these meetings has been posted on 
the UNFCCC website.23 

14.  On 19 and 21 October, the Co-Chairs convened stocktaking meetings to discuss the 
approach for the session. Based on those consultations, the Co-Chairs provided Parties with 
further guidance for work in the remainder of the session.24 On 22 and 23 October, the ADP 
took further stock of the progress of work. 

15.  At  its  22nd  plenary  meeting,  the  ADP  had  before  it  the  work  of  the  contact  group 
dated 23 October 2015, referred to in paragraph 12 above.  

16. 
Parties  agreed  to  forward  the  outcome  of  their  work  contained  in  the  draft  Paris 
agreement and accompanying draft decision on  workstream 1 and  workstream 2 dated 23 
October  2015  for  further  work  at  the  twelfth  part  of  the  session.  In  preparation  for  the 
twelfth part of the session, Parties also requested that the Co-Chairs task the secretariat with 
preparing  a  technical  paper.25  This  paper  was  to  identify  closely  related  paragraphs  and 
duplications within sections, as well as possible areas for streamlining. Parties clearly stated 
that this paper be restricted to an editorial exercise to clean up the text without changing its 
content. 

17.  Closing statements were made on behalf of the Presidency of COP 20/CMP 10 and 
the  incoming  Presidency  of  COP  21/CMP  11.  In  addition,  one  Party  made  a  statement 
available on the UNFCCC website.26

Ahead  of  the  21st  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs,  with  the  assistance  of  the  co-facilitators

mentioned non-paper, as well as to  the scenario note prepared for the  eleventh part of the 
session11  and  a  document  entitled  “Further  clarification  on  the  mode  of  work  of  the 
session”.12 This clarification was prepared by the Co-Chairs following their extensive pre-
sessional  consultations  with  Parties.  The  organization  of  the  work  on  agenda  item  3  as 
clarified  by  the  Co-Chairs  included  a  contact  group  established  at  the  fourth  part  of  the 
session13 and spin-off group meetings on specific articles of the Co-Chairs’ non-paper. The 
ADP proceeded on the basis of this proposal. 

In addition, the Co-Chairs informed Parties of their intention to hold a special event

8  above,  namely  the  Co-Chairs’  non-paper  containing  the  draft  agreement  and  draft 
decision, the draft decision on workstream 2 of the ADP, the scenario note prepared for the 
eleventh part of the session and a document containing further clarification on the mode of 
work of the session, as well as a note on the agreed mode of work at ADP 2.1116 and the 
report of the ADP on the tenth part of its second session.17 

Throughout the session, Party inputs to the negotiations18 as well as the work of the 
12. 
spin-off group meetings were captured and made publicly available daily on the UNFCCC 
website.19 Two versions of the draft agreement and draft decision were published on 20 and 
23 October.20 The version of 23 October was also made available as  an advance unedited 
version  on  the  UNFCCC  website.  The  final  version  of  the  working  document  was  also 
made available on the UNFCCC website.21 

13. 
In the context of work on workstream 2, including on how to further advance pre-
2020  climate  action,  a  technical  paper  containing  the  updated  compilation  of  information 
on mitigation benefits of actions, initiatives and options to enhance mitigation ambition and 
its  addenda  on  renewable  energy  supply  and  energy  efficiency  in  urban  environments22 
were  made  available  on  16  October.  During  the  session,  Parties  exchanged  views  on 
workstream 2 in spin-off group meetings. The output of these meetings has been posted on 
the UNFCCC website.23 

14.  On 19 and 21 October, the Co-Chairs convened stocktaking meetings to discuss the 
approach for the session. Based on those consultations, the Co-Chairs provided Parties with 
further guidance for work in the remainder of the session.24 On 22 and 23 October, the ADP 
took further stock of the progress of work. 

15.  At  its  22nd  plenary  meeting,  the  ADP  had  before  it  the  work  of  the  contact  group 
dated 23 October 2015, referred to in paragraph 12 above.  

16. 
Parties  agreed  to  forward  the  outcome  of  their  work  contained  in  the  draft  Paris 
agreement and accompanying draft decision on  workstream 1 and  workstream 2 dated 23 
October  2015  for  further  work  at  the  twelfth  part  of  the  session.  In  preparation  for  the 
twelfth part of the session, Parties also requested that the Co-Chairs task the secretariat with 
preparing  a  technical  paper.25  This  paper  was  to  identify  closely  related  paragraphs  and 
duplications within sections, as well as possible areas for streamlining. Parties clearly stated 
that this paper be restricted to an editorial exercise to clean up the text without changing its 
content. 

17.  Closing statements were made on behalf of the Presidency of COP 20/CMP 10 and 
the  incoming  Presidency  of  COP  21/CMP  11.  In  addition,  one  Party  made  a  statement 
available on the UNFCCC website.26

version  on  the  UNFCCC  website.  The  final  version  of  the  working  document  was  also 
made available on the UNFCCC website.21

twelfth part of the session, Parties also requested that the Co-Chairs task the secretariat with 
preparing  a  technical  paper.25  This  paper  was  to  identify  closely  related  paragraphs  and 
duplications within sections, as well as possible areas for streamlining. Parties clearly stated 
that this paper be restricted to an editorial exercise to clean up the text without changing its 
content. 

17.  Closing statements were made on behalf of the Presidency of COP 20/CMP 10 and

sessional  consultations  with  Parties.  The  organization  of  the  work  on  agenda  item  3  as 
clarified  by  the  Co-Chairs  included  a  contact  group  established  at  the  fourth  part  of  the

sessional  consultations  with  Parties.  The  organization  of  the  work  on  agenda  item  3  as 
clarified  by  the  Co-Chairs  included  a  contact  group  established  at  the  fourth  part  of  the 
session13 and spin-off group meetings on specific articles of the Co-Chairs’ non-paper. The

eleventh part of the session and a document containing further clarification on the mode of 
work of the session, as well as a note on the agreed mode of work at ADP 2.1116 and the 
report of the ADP on the tenth part of its second session.17 

Throughout the session, Party inputs to the negotiations18 as well as the work of the 
12. 
spin-off group meetings were captured and made publicly available daily on the UNFCCC 
website.19 Two versions of the draft agreement and draft decision were published on 20 and 
23 October.20 The version of 23 October was also made available as  an advance unedited 
version  on  the  UNFCCC  website.  The  final  version  of  the  working  document  was  also 
made available on the UNFCCC website.21 

13. 
In the context of work on workstream 2, including on how to further advance pre-
2020  climate  action,  a  technical  paper  containing  the  updated  compilation  of  information 
on mitigation benefits of actions, initiatives and options to enhance mitigation ambition and 
its  addenda  on  renewable  energy  supply  and  energy  efficiency  in  urban  environments22 
were  made  available  on  16  October.  During  the  session,  Parties  exchanged  views  on 
workstream 2 in spin-off group meetings. The output of these meetings has been posted on 
the UNFCCC website.23 

14.  On 19 and 21 October, the Co-Chairs convened stocktaking meetings to discuss the 
approach for the session. Based on those consultations, the Co-Chairs provided Parties with 
further guidance for work in the remainder of the session.24 On 22 and 23 October, the ADP 
took further stock of the progress of work. 

15.  At  its  22nd  plenary  meeting,  the  ADP  had  before  it  the  work  of  the  contact  group 
dated 23 October 2015, referred to in paragraph 12 above.

Parties  agreed  to  forward  the  outcome  of  their  work  contained  in  the  draft  Paris 
agreement and accompanying draft decision on  workstream 1 and  workstream 2 dated 23 
October  2015  for  further  work  at  the  twelfth  part  of  the  session.  In  preparation  for  the 
twelfth part of the session, Parties also requested that the Co-Chairs task the secretariat with 
preparing  a  technical  paper.25  This  paper  was  to  identify  closely  related  paragraphs  and 
duplications within sections, as well as possible areas for streamlining. Parties clearly stated 
that this paper be restricted to an editorial exercise to clean up the text without changing its 
content. 

17.  Closing statements were made on behalf of the Presidency of COP 20/CMP 10 and 
the  incoming  Presidency  of  COP  21/CMP  11.  In  addition,  one  Party  made  a  statement 
available on the UNFCCC website.26

Ahead  of  the  21st  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs,  with  the  assistance  of  the  co-facilitators

At  the  21st  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  drew  the  delegates’  attention  to  the  above-
8. 
mentioned non-paper, as well as to  the scenario note prepared for the  eleventh part of the 
session11  and  a  document  entitled  “Further  clarification  on  the  mode  of  work  of  the 
session”.12 This clarification was prepared by the Co-Chairs following their extensive pre-
sessional  consultations  with  Parties.  The  organization  of  the  work  on  agenda  item  3  as 
clarified  by  the  Co-Chairs  included  a  contact  group  established  at  the  fourth  part  of  the 
session13 and spin-off group meetings on specific articles of the Co-Chairs’ non-paper. The 
ADP proceeded on the basis of this proposal. 

In addition, the Co-Chairs informed Parties of their intention to hold a special event

with observers during the session. This event took place on 21 October.14 

10.  Other events and briefings held during the eleventh part of the session include:

8  above,  namely  the  Co-Chairs’  non-paper  containing  the  draft  agreement  and  draft 
decision, the draft decision on workstream 2 of the ADP, the scenario note prepared for the 
eleventh part of the session and a document containing further clarification on the mode of 
work of the session, as well as a note on the agreed mode of work at ADP 2.1116 and the 
report of the ADP on the tenth part of its second session.17 

Throughout the session, Party inputs to the negotiations18 as well as the work of the 
12. 
spin-off group meetings were captured and made publicly available daily on the UNFCCC 
website.19 Two versions of the draft agreement and draft decision were published on 20 and 
23 October.20 The version of 23 October was also made available as  an advance unedited 
version  on  the  UNFCCC  website.  The  final  version  of  the  working  document  was  also 
made available on the UNFCCC website.21 

13. 
In the context of work on workstream 2, including on how to further advance pre-
2020  climate  action,  a  technical  paper  containing  the  updated  compilation  of  information 
on mitigation benefits of actions, initiatives and options to enhance mitigation ambition and 
its  addenda  on  renewable  energy  supply  and  energy  efficiency  in  urban  environments22 
were  made  available  on  16  October.  During  the  session,  Parties  exchanged  views  on 
workstream 2 in spin-off group meetings. The output of these meetings has been posted on 
the UNFCCC website.23 

14.  On 19 and 21 October, the Co-Chairs convened stocktaking meetings to discuss the 
approach for the session. Based on those consultations, the Co-Chairs provided Parties with 
further guidance for work in the remainder of the session.24 On 22 and 23 October, the ADP 
took further stock of the progress of work. 

15.  At  its  22nd  plenary  meeting,  the  ADP  had  before  it  the  work  of  the  contact  group 
dated 23 October 2015, referred to in paragraph 12 above.  

16. 
Parties  agreed  to  forward  the  outcome  of  their  work  contained  in  the  draft  Paris 
agreement and accompanying draft decision on  workstream 1 and  workstream 2 dated 23 
October  2015  for  further  work  at  the  twelfth  part  of  the  session.  In  preparation  for  the 
twelfth part of the session, Parties also requested that the Co-Chairs task the secretariat with 
preparing  a  technical  paper.25  This  paper  was  to  identify  closely  related  paragraphs  and 
duplications within sections, as well as possible areas for streamlining. Parties clearly stated 
that this paper be restricted to an editorial exercise to clean up the text without changing its 
content. 

17.  Closing statements were made on behalf of the Presidency of COP 20/CMP 10 and 
the  incoming  Presidency  of  COP  21/CMP  11.  In  addition,  one  Party  made  a  statement 
available on the UNFCCC website.26
