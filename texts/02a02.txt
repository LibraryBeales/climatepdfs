the  relevant  requirements  of  the  training  programme  will  be  invited  to  participate  in  a 
centralized  or  in-country  review,  working  alongside  experienced  GHG  inventory  review 
experts. 

4. 
Experts who do not pass an examination for a course at the first attempt may retake 
the examination one additional time, provided that the  expert has fulfilled all of the tasks 
assigned during the course in a timely manner and that the retake does not incur additional

Annex 

Training programme for members of expert review teams participating 
in annual reviews under Article 8 of the Kyoto Protocol 

A.  Details of the training programme 

1. 
The  courses  of  the  training  programme  are  intended  to  train  members  of  expert 
review teams (ERTs) for the review of information submitted under Article 7 of the Kyoto 
Protocol.  All training courses will be available online. For trainees without easy access to 
the  Internet,  courses  will  be  distributed  through  electronic  means;  for  courses  that  are 
facilitated  by  an  instructor,  trainees  will  communicate  with  the  instructor  by  electronic 
means.  At  the  request  of  a  Party,  the  courses  will  also  be  made  available  for  others 
interested  in  the  review  process,  provided  that  this  does  not  require  additional  resources. 
All  courses  will  be  available  upon  request  to  trainees  year-round  without  facilitation  by 
instructors. 

All  training  courses  will  include  an  examination.  Examination  procedures  will  be 

2. 
standardized, objective and transparent. Examinations will take place online. 

3. 
New  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  inventory  review  experts  who  successfully  complete 
the  relevant  requirements  of  the  training  programme  will  be  invited  to  participate  in  a 
centralized  or  in-country  review,  working  alongside  experienced  GHG  inventory  review 
experts. 

4. 
Experts who do not pass an examination for a course at the first attempt may retake 
the examination one additional time, provided that the  expert has fulfilled all of the tasks 
assigned during the course in a timely manner and that the retake does not incur additional 
costs for the secretariat. 

5. 
Experts with relevant expertise will be invited to act as instructors for courses of the 
training programme, ensuring that their skills  cover the subjects addressed in each course. 
They will provide advice and support by e-mail or other electronic means. The secretariat 
will  seek  to  achieve  a  geographical  balance  among  the  instructors  participating  in  the 
training programme.
