Article  6  of  the  Convention  –  education,  training,  public  awareness,  public  participation, 
public access to information, and international cooperation on these matters,

resources continues to be a challenge for the implementation of Article 6 of the Convention 
for Parties, in particular African countries, the  least developed countries and small island 
developing States,

activities related to Article 6 of the Convention, 

Re-emphasizing  the  importance  of  building  and  strengthening  the  skills  and

organization  of  workshops,  videoconferences  and  activities  at  the  international,  regional 
and national levels, 

Recalling  the  invitation  to  multilateral  and  bilateral  institutions  and  organizations, 
including operating entities of the Financial Mechanism of the Convention, as appropriate, 
to provide financial support for the activities relating to the implementation of Article 6 of 
the Convention, 

Also  recalling  the  Lima  Ministerial  Declaration  on  Education  and  Awareness-
raising,1  which  stresses  that  education,  training,  public  awareness,  public  participation, 
public access to information, knowledge and international cooperation play a fundamental 
role in meeting the ultimate objective of the Convention and in promoting climate-resilient 
sustainable development, 

1. 
Requests the Subsidiary Body for Implementation to launch the intermediate review

Note: Assumptions used for calculating the conference services contingency budget include the following: 
  The expected number of meetings with interpretation does not exceed 40 per session; 
  The expected documentation volume is based on the calculations provided by the United Nations Office at Geneva; 
  Meetings services support includes staff normally provided by the United Nations Office at Geneva conference services for 

the in-session coordination and support of interpretation, translation and reproduction services; 

  Overall, the figures used are conservative and have been applied on the assumption that there will be no major increase in 

requirements during the biennium.  

a   Includes salaries, travel and daily subsistence allowance for interpreters. 
b   Includes all costs related to the processing of pre-, in- and post-session documentation; translation costs include revision and 

typing of documents. 

c   Includes salaries, travel and daily subsistence allowance for meetings services support staff and costs of shipment and 

telecommunications.

Draft decision -/CMP.11 

Methodology for the collection of international transaction 
log fees in the biennium 2016–2017 

The  Conference  of  the  Parties  serving  as  the  meeting  of  the  Parties  to  the  Kyoto 

Protocol, 

Recalling Article 13, paragraph 5, of the Kyoto Protocol, 

Also recalling decisions 11/CMP.3, 10/CMP.5, 9/CMP.6 and 8/CMP.8, 

Recognizing  the  importance  of  sufficient  and  stable  funding  for  the  international 

transaction log, 

Adopts the scale of fees for the international transaction log for the biennium 2016–

1. 
2017 contained in the annex; 

2. 
Decides  that  fees  for  the  international  transaction  log  paid  by  a  Party  for  the 
biennium 2016–2017 shall be calculated by multiplying the scale of fees for that Party, as 
contained in the annex, by the budget for the international transaction log for the biennium 
2016–2017, with the fees for the first year of the biennium being equal to the fees  for the 
second year of the biennium; 

3. 
Requests  the  Executive  Secretary  to  notify  Parties  connected  to  the  international 
transaction  log  in  the  biennium  2016–2017  of  the  annual  fees,  calculated  in  accordance 
with  paragraph  2  above,  as  early  as  possible  and  at  least  four  months  in  advance  of  the 
relevant calendar year, where possible; 

4. 
Decides that, if a Party connects to the international transaction log for the first time 
or  reconnects  to  it  following  disconnection  during  the  biennium  2016–2017,  the  scale  of 
fees for that Party shall be that contained in the annex, or, for Parties not listed in the table 
contained in the annex, shall be made equal to 130 per cent of their Kyoto Protocol adjusted 
scale for the relevant biennium; 

Also decides that fees paid by a Party that connects to the international transaction 
5. 
log for the first time shall be deducted from the resource requirement for activities relating 
to the international transaction log in the next biennium; 

6. 
Further  decides  that  fees  paid  by  a  Party  that  connects  to  the  international 
transaction  log  for  the  first  time  or,  following  disconnection,  reconnects  to  it  during  the 
biennium 2016–2017, shall be proportioned for the period between the date of connection 
or reconnection of its registry and the end of the biennium, except for the period for which 
the fees were already paid; 

Decides that, where a Party disconnects during the biennium 2016–2017, the Party 
7. 
shall cover the fees for the full year in which the disconnection took place, and that, if the 
disconnection takes place in the first year of the biennium and the Party does not reconnect 
in the second year of the biennium, fees for the second year of the biennium shall not apply; 

8. 
Authorizes the  international transaction log administrator  to disconnect  the registry 
of a Party from the international transaction log in the event of the non-payment of its fees 
by  that  Party,  provided  that  such  disconnection  shall  not  be  effected  earlier  than  four 
months  after  the  beginning  of  the  relevant  calendar  year,  at  least  two  reminders  have 
already been given to the Party and consultations have taken place with the Party concerned 
prior to the final reminder;

FCCC/SBI/2015/10/Add.1 

9. 
Also  authorizes  the  Executive  Secretary  to  draw  up  funds  from  unspent  balances 
(carry-over) of the Trust Fund for the International Transaction Log from previous financial 
periods to cover the potential shortfall in fees due to the disconnection of Parties during the 
biennium 2016–2017; 

Requests  the  international  transaction  log  administrator  to  provide,  in  its  annual 

10. 
reports for 2016 and 2017, information on transactions of Kyoto Protocol units; 

Also requests the international transaction log administrator to publish, in its annual 
11. 
reports,  a  table  listing  the  scale  and  the  level  of  fees  and  the  status  of  payments  for  all 
Parties connected to the international transaction log.

  Draft decision -/CP.21 

  Terms of reference for the intermediate review of the Doha  

work programme on Article 6 of the Convention 

The Conference of the Parties, 

Recalling decision 15/CP.18, 

Recognizing  the  progress  made  by  Parties,  international  organizations  and  civil 
society in planning, coordinating and implementing activities relating to all the elements of 
Article  6  of  the  Convention  –  education,  training,  public  awareness,  public  participation, 
public access to information, and international cooperation on these matters, 

Also recognizing that ensuring the availability of  sufficient financial and technical 
resources continues to be a challenge for the implementation of Article 6 of the Convention 
for Parties, in particular African countries, the  least developed countries and small island 
developing States, 

Reaffirming  the  importance  of  taking  into  account  gender  aspects  and  the  need  to 
promote  the  effective  engagement  of  children,  youth,  the  elderly,  women,  persons  with 
disabilities, indigenous peoples, local communities and non-governmental organizations in 
activities related to Article 6 of the Convention, 

Re-emphasizing  the  importance  of  building  and  strengthening  the  skills  and 
capacities of national focal points for Article 6 of the Convention, including by continuing 
to  facilitate  a  regular  exchange  of  views,  good  practices  and  lessons  learned  through  the 
organization  of  workshops,  videoconferences  and  activities  at  the  international,  regional 
and national levels, 

Recalling  the  invitation  to  multilateral  and  bilateral  institutions  and  organizations, 
including operating entities of the Financial Mechanism of the Convention, as appropriate, 
to provide financial support for the activities relating to the implementation of Article 6 of 
the Convention, 

Also  recalling  the  Lima  Ministerial  Declaration  on  Education  and  Awareness-
raising,1  which  stresses  that  education,  training,  public  awareness,  public  participation, 
public access to information, knowledge and international cooperation play a fundamental 
role in meeting the ultimate objective of the Convention and in promoting climate-resilient 
sustainable development, 

1. 
Requests the Subsidiary Body for Implementation to launch the intermediate review 
of the implementation of the Doha work programme on Article 6 of the Convention at its 
forty-fourth  session  (May  2016)  on  the  basis  of  the  terms  of  reference  contained  in  the 
annex, with a view to the review being completed by December 2016; 

2. 
Encourages  United Nations organizations, in particular the  members of the United 
Nations Alliance on Climate Change Education, Training and Public Awareness, to submit 
information  on  the  results  of  their  activities,  including  reports  from  relevant  regional  and 
subregional workshops, as appropriate, in order to support the implementation of the Doha 
work programme; 

3. 
Requests  the  Global  Environment  Facility  to  report  on  the  progress  made  in 
providing financial support and implementing activities to contribute to the implementation 
of the Doha work programme;

4. 
Invites multilateral and bilateral institutions and organizations, the private sector and 
donors  to  report  on  financial  resources  provided  to  support  the  activities  relating  to  the 
implementation of Article 6 of the Convention; 

5. 

Requests the secretariat: 

(a) 

To prepare a report on the progress made, as well as emerging gaps, needs, 
and recommendations by Parties, admitted observer organizations and other stakeholders in 
implementing the Doha  work programme as input to the intermediate review, as specified 
in  paragraph  5  of  the  terms  of  reference  contained  in  the  annex,  for  consideration  by  the 
Subsidiary Body for Implementation at its forty-fourth session; 

(b) 

To  continue  facilitating  a  regular  exchange  of  views,  good  practices  and 

lessons learned among national focal points for Article 6 of the Convention; 

(c) 

To  continue  collaborating  with  admitted  observer  organizations  and  other 
stakeholders  and  the  members  of  the  United  Nations  Alliance  on  Climate  Change 
Education,  Training  and  Public  Awareness  so  as  to  catalyse  action  on  Article  6  of  the 
Convention; 

Also  requests  that  the  actions  of  the  secretariat  called  for  in  this  decision  be 

6. 
undertaken subject to the availability of financial resources.

Annex 

Terms of reference for the intermediate review of the progress made in 
the implementation of the Doha work programme on Article 6 of the 
Convention 

I.  Mandate 

1. 
At its eighteenth session, the Conference of the Parties (COP) adopted the eight-year 
Doha  work  programme  on  Article  6  of  the  Convention  and  decided  that  it  would  be 
reviewed  in  2020,  with  an  intermediate  review  of  progress  in  2016,  to  evaluate  its 
effectiveness,  identify  any  emerging  gaps  and  needs,  and  inform  any  decisions  on 
improving the effectiveness of the work programme, as appropriate.1 

2. 
By  the  same  decision,  the  COP  requested  the  secretariat  to  prepare  reports  on  the 
progress  made  by  Parties  in  implementing  Article  6  of  the  Convention  based  on

  The expected number of meetings with interpretation does not exceed 40 per session; 
  The expected documentation volume is based on the calculations provided by the United Nations Office at Geneva; 
  Meetings services support includes staff normally provided by the United Nations Office at Geneva conference services for 

the in-session coordination and support of interpretation, translation and reproduction services; 

  Overall, the figures used are conservative and have been applied on the assumption that there will be no major increase in 

requirements during the biennium.  

a   Includes salaries, travel and daily subsistence allowance for interpreters. 
b   Includes all costs related to the processing of pre-, in- and post-session documentation; translation costs include revision and

Draft decision -/CMP.11 

Methodology for the collection of international transaction 
log fees in the biennium 2016–2017 

The  Conference  of  the  Parties  serving  as  the  meeting  of  the  Parties  to  the  Kyoto 

Protocol, 

Recalling Article 13, paragraph 5, of the Kyoto Protocol, 

Also recalling decisions 11/CMP.3, 10/CMP.5, 9/CMP.6 and 8/CMP.8, 

Recognizing  the  importance  of  sufficient  and  stable  funding  for  the  international 

transaction log, 

Adopts the scale of fees for the international transaction log for the biennium 2016–

1. 
2017 contained in the annex; 

2. 
Decides  that  fees  for  the  international  transaction  log  paid  by  a  Party  for  the 
biennium 2016–2017 shall be calculated by multiplying the scale of fees for that Party, as 
contained in the annex, by the budget for the international transaction log for the biennium 
2016–2017, with the fees for the first year of the biennium being equal to the fees  for the 
second year of the biennium; 

3. 
Requests  the  Executive  Secretary  to  notify  Parties  connected  to  the  international 
transaction  log  in  the  biennium  2016–2017  of  the  annual  fees,  calculated  in  accordance 
with  paragraph  2  above,  as  early  as  possible  and  at  least  four  months  in  advance  of  the 
relevant calendar year, where possible; 

4. 
Decides that, if a Party connects to the international transaction log for the first time 
or  reconnects  to  it  following  disconnection  during  the  biennium  2016–2017,  the  scale  of 
fees for that Party shall be that contained in the annex, or, for Parties not listed in the table 
contained in the annex, shall be made equal to 130 per cent of their Kyoto Protocol adjusted 
scale for the relevant biennium; 

Also decides that fees paid by a Party that connects to the international transaction 
5. 
log for the first time shall be deducted from the resource requirement for activities relating 
to the international transaction log in the next biennium; 

6. 
Further  decides  that  fees  paid  by  a  Party  that  connects  to  the  international 
transaction  log  for  the  first  time  or,  following  disconnection,  reconnects  to  it  during  the 
biennium 2016–2017, shall be proportioned for the period between the date of connection 
or reconnection of its registry and the end of the biennium, except for the period for which 
the fees were already paid; 

Decides that, where a Party disconnects during the biennium 2016–2017, the Party 
7. 
shall cover the fees for the full year in which the disconnection took place, and that, if the 
disconnection takes place in the first year of the biennium and the Party does not reconnect 
in the second year of the biennium, fees for the second year of the biennium shall not apply; 

8. 
Authorizes the  international transaction log administrator  to disconnect  the registry 
of a Party from the international transaction log in the event of the non-payment of its fees 
by  that  Party,  provided  that  such  disconnection  shall  not  be  effected  earlier  than  four 
months  after  the  beginning  of  the  relevant  calendar  year,  at  least  two  reminders  have 
already been given to the Party and consultations have taken place with the Party concerned 
prior to the final reminder; 

27 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
FCCC/SBI/2015/10/Add.1 

9. 
Also  authorizes  the  Executive  Secretary  to  draw  up  funds  from  unspent  balances 
(carry-over) of the Trust Fund for the International Transaction Log from previous financial 
periods to cover the potential shortfall in fees due to the disconnection of Parties during the 
biennium 2016–2017; 

Requests  the  international  transaction  log  administrator  to  provide,  in  its  annual 

10. 
reports for 2016 and 2017, information on transactions of Kyoto Protocol units; 

Also requests the international transaction log administrator to publish, in its annual 
11. 
reports,  a  table  listing  the  scale  and  the  level  of  fees  and  the  status  of  payments  for  all 
Parties connected to the international transaction log.

society in planning, coordinating and implementing activities relating to all the elements of 
Article  6  of  the  Convention  –  education,  training,  public  awareness,  public  participation, 
public access to information, and international cooperation on these matters, 

Also recognizing that ensuring the availability of  sufficient financial and technical 
resources continues to be a challenge for the implementation of Article 6 of the Convention 
for Parties, in particular African countries, the  least developed countries and small island 
developing States, 

Reaffirming  the  importance  of  taking  into  account  gender  aspects  and  the  need  to 
promote  the  effective  engagement  of  children,  youth,  the  elderly,  women,  persons  with 
disabilities, indigenous peoples, local communities and non-governmental organizations in 
activities related to Article 6 of the Convention, 

Re-emphasizing  the  importance  of  building  and  strengthening  the  skills  and 
capacities of national focal points for Article 6 of the Convention, including by continuing 
to  facilitate  a  regular  exchange  of  views,  good  practices  and  lessons  learned  through  the 
organization  of  workshops,  videoconferences  and  activities  at  the  international,  regional 
and national levels, 

Recalling  the  invitation  to  multilateral  and  bilateral  institutions  and  organizations, 
including operating entities of the Financial Mechanism of the Convention, as appropriate, 
to provide financial support for the activities relating to the implementation of Article 6 of 
the Convention, 

Also  recalling  the  Lima  Ministerial  Declaration  on  Education  and  Awareness-
raising,1  which  stresses  that  education,  training,  public  awareness,  public  participation, 
public access to information, knowledge and international cooperation play a fundamental 
role in meeting the ultimate objective of the Convention and in promoting climate-resilient 
sustainable development, 

1. 
Requests the Subsidiary Body for Implementation to launch the intermediate review 
of the implementation of the Doha work programme on Article 6 of the Convention at its 
forty-fourth  session  (May  2016)  on  the  basis  of  the  terms  of  reference  contained  in  the 
annex, with a view to the review being completed by December 2016; 

2. 
Encourages  United Nations organizations, in particular the  members of the United 
Nations Alliance on Climate Change Education, Training and Public Awareness, to submit 
information  on  the  results  of  their  activities,  including  reports  from  relevant  regional  and 
subregional workshops, as appropriate, in order to support the implementation of the Doha 
work programme; 

3. 
Requests  the  Global  Environment  Facility  to  report  on  the  progress  made  in 
providing financial support and implementing activities to contribute to the implementation 
of the Doha work programme;

To  continue  facilitating  a  regular  exchange  of  views,  good  practices  and 

lessons learned among national focal points for Article 6 of the Convention;

1. 
2017 contained in the annex; 

2. 
Decides  that  fees  for  the  international  transaction  log  paid  by  a  Party  for  the 
biennium 2016–2017 shall be calculated by multiplying the scale of fees for that Party, as 
contained in the annex, by the budget for the international transaction log for the biennium 
2016–2017, with the fees for the first year of the biennium being equal to the fees  for the 
second year of the biennium; 

3. 
Requests  the  Executive  Secretary  to  notify  Parties  connected  to  the  international 
transaction  log  in  the  biennium  2016–2017  of  the  annual  fees,  calculated  in  accordance 
with  paragraph  2  above,  as  early  as  possible  and  at  least  four  months  in  advance  of  the 
relevant calendar year, where possible; 

4. 
Decides that, if a Party connects to the international transaction log for the first time 
or  reconnects  to  it  following  disconnection  during  the  biennium  2016–2017,  the  scale  of 
fees for that Party shall be that contained in the annex, or, for Parties not listed in the table 
contained in the annex, shall be made equal to 130 per cent of their Kyoto Protocol adjusted 
scale for the relevant biennium; 

Also decides that fees paid by a Party that connects to the international transaction 
5. 
log for the first time shall be deducted from the resource requirement for activities relating 
to the international transaction log in the next biennium; 

6. 
Further  decides  that  fees  paid  by  a  Party  that  connects  to  the  international 
transaction  log  for  the  first  time  or,  following  disconnection,  reconnects  to  it  during  the 
biennium 2016–2017, shall be proportioned for the period between the date of connection 
or reconnection of its registry and the end of the biennium, except for the period for which 
the fees were already paid; 

Decides that, where a Party disconnects during the biennium 2016–2017, the Party 
7. 
shall cover the fees for the full year in which the disconnection took place, and that, if the 
disconnection takes place in the first year of the biennium and the Party does not reconnect 
in the second year of the biennium, fees for the second year of the biennium shall not apply; 

8. 
Authorizes the  international transaction log administrator  to disconnect  the registry 
of a Party from the international transaction log in the event of the non-payment of its fees 
by  that  Party,  provided  that  such  disconnection  shall  not  be  effected  earlier  than  four 
months  after  the  beginning  of  the  relevant  calendar  year,  at  least  two  reminders  have 
already been given to the Party and consultations have taken place with the Party concerned 
prior to the final reminder;

9. 
Also  authorizes  the  Executive  Secretary  to  draw  up  funds  from  unspent  balances 
(carry-over) of the Trust Fund for the International Transaction Log from previous financial 
periods to cover the potential shortfall in fees due to the disconnection of Parties during the 
biennium 2016–2017; 

Requests  the  international  transaction  log  administrator  to  provide,  in  its  annual 

10. 
reports for 2016 and 2017, information on transactions of Kyoto Protocol units; 

Also requests the international transaction log administrator to publish, in its annual 
11.

and national levels, 

Recalling  the  invitation  to  multilateral  and  bilateral  institutions  and  organizations, 
including operating entities of the Financial Mechanism of the Convention, as appropriate, 
to provide financial support for the activities relating to the implementation of Article 6 of

Also  recalling  the  Lima  Ministerial  Declaration  on  Education  and  Awareness-
raising,1  which  stresses  that  education,  training,  public  awareness,  public  participation, 
public access to information, knowledge and international cooperation play a fundamental 
role in meeting the ultimate objective of the Convention and in promoting climate-resilient 
sustainable development, 

1. 
Requests the Subsidiary Body for Implementation to launch the intermediate review 
of the implementation of the Doha work programme on Article 6 of the Convention at its

Note: Assumptions used for calculating the conference services contingency budget include the following: 
  The expected number of meetings with interpretation does not exceed 40 per session; 
  The expected documentation volume is based on the calculations provided by the United Nations Office at Geneva; 
  Meetings services support includes staff normally provided by the United Nations Office at Geneva conference services for 

the in-session coordination and support of interpretation, translation and reproduction services; 

  Overall, the figures used are conservative and have been applied on the assumption that there will be no major increase in 

requirements during the biennium.  

a   Includes salaries, travel and daily subsistence allowance for interpreters. 
b   Includes all costs related to the processing of pre-, in- and post-session documentation; translation costs include revision and 

typing of documents.

Draft decision -/CMP.11 

Methodology for the collection of international transaction 
log fees in the biennium 2016–2017 

The  Conference  of  the  Parties  serving  as  the  meeting  of  the  Parties  to  the  Kyoto 

Protocol, 

Recalling Article 13, paragraph 5, of the Kyoto Protocol, 

Also recalling decisions 11/CMP.3, 10/CMP.5, 9/CMP.6 and 8/CMP.8, 

Recognizing  the  importance  of  sufficient  and  stable  funding  for  the  international 

transaction log, 

Adopts the scale of fees for the international transaction log for the biennium 2016–

1. 
2017 contained in the annex; 

2. 
Decides  that  fees  for  the  international  transaction  log  paid  by  a  Party  for  the 
biennium 2016–2017 shall be calculated by multiplying the scale of fees for that Party, as 
contained in the annex, by the budget for the international transaction log for the biennium 
2016–2017, with the fees for the first year of the biennium being equal to the fees  for the 
second year of the biennium; 

3. 
Requests  the  Executive  Secretary  to  notify  Parties  connected  to  the  international 
transaction  log  in  the  biennium  2016–2017  of  the  annual  fees,  calculated  in  accordance 
with  paragraph  2  above,  as  early  as  possible  and  at  least  four  months  in  advance  of  the 
relevant calendar year, where possible; 

4. 
Decides that, if a Party connects to the international transaction log for the first time 
or  reconnects  to  it  following  disconnection  during  the  biennium  2016–2017,  the  scale  of 
fees for that Party shall be that contained in the annex, or, for Parties not listed in the table 
contained in the annex, shall be made equal to 130 per cent of their Kyoto Protocol adjusted 
scale for the relevant biennium; 

Also decides that fees paid by a Party that connects to the international transaction 
5. 
log for the first time shall be deducted from the resource requirement for activities relating 
to the international transaction log in the next biennium; 

6. 
Further  decides  that  fees  paid  by  a  Party  that  connects  to  the  international 
transaction  log  for  the  first  time  or,  following  disconnection,  reconnects  to  it  during  the 
biennium 2016–2017, shall be proportioned for the period between the date of connection 
or reconnection of its registry and the end of the biennium, except for the period for which 
the fees were already paid; 

Decides that, where a Party disconnects during the biennium 2016–2017, the Party 
7. 
shall cover the fees for the full year in which the disconnection took place, and that, if the 
disconnection takes place in the first year of the biennium and the Party does not reconnect 
in the second year of the biennium, fees for the second year of the biennium shall not apply; 

8. 
Authorizes the  international transaction log administrator  to disconnect  the registry 
of a Party from the international transaction log in the event of the non-payment of its fees 
by  that  Party,  provided  that  such  disconnection  shall  not  be  effected  earlier  than  four 
months  after  the  beginning  of  the  relevant  calendar  year,  at  least  two  reminders  have 
already been given to the Party and consultations have taken place with the Party concerned 
prior to the final reminder;

FCCC/SBI/2015/10/Add.1 

9. 
Also  authorizes  the  Executive  Secretary  to  draw  up  funds  from  unspent  balances 
(carry-over) of the Trust Fund for the International Transaction Log from previous financial 
periods to cover the potential shortfall in fees due to the disconnection of Parties during the 
biennium 2016–2017; 

Requests  the  international  transaction  log  administrator  to  provide,  in  its  annual 

10. 
reports for 2016 and 2017, information on transactions of Kyoto Protocol units; 

Also requests the international transaction log administrator to publish, in its annual 
11. 
reports,  a  table  listing  the  scale  and  the  level  of  fees  and  the  status  of  payments  for  all 
Parties connected to the international transaction log.

Also  recalling  the  Lima  Ministerial  Declaration  on  Education  and  Awareness-
raising,1  which  stresses  that  education,  training,  public  awareness,  public  participation, 
public access to information, knowledge and international cooperation play a fundamental 
role in meeting the ultimate objective of the Convention and in promoting climate-resilient 
sustainable development,

Note: Assumptions used for calculating the conference services contingency budget include the following: 
  The expected number of meetings with interpretation does not exceed 40 per session; 
  The expected documentation volume is based on the calculations provided by the United Nations Office at Geneva; 
  Meetings services support includes staff normally provided by the United Nations Office at Geneva conference services for 

the in-session coordination and support of interpretation, translation and reproduction services; 

  Overall, the figures used are conservative and have been applied on the assumption that there will be no major increase in 

requirements during the biennium.  

a   Includes salaries, travel and daily subsistence allowance for interpreters. 
b   Includes all costs related to the processing of pre-, in- and post-session documentation; translation costs include revision and 

typing of documents. 

c   Includes salaries, travel and daily subsistence allowance for meetings services support staff and costs of shipment and 

telecommunications.

Draft decision -/CMP.11 

Methodology for the collection of international transaction 
log fees in the biennium 2016–2017 

The  Conference  of  the  Parties  serving  as  the  meeting  of  the  Parties  to  the  Kyoto 

Protocol, 

Recalling Article 13, paragraph 5, of the Kyoto Protocol, 

Also recalling decisions 11/CMP.3, 10/CMP.5, 9/CMP.6 and 8/CMP.8, 

Recognizing  the  importance  of  sufficient  and  stable  funding  for  the  international 

transaction log, 

Adopts the scale of fees for the international transaction log for the biennium 2016–

1. 
2017 contained in the annex; 

2. 
Decides  that  fees  for  the  international  transaction  log  paid  by  a  Party  for  the 
biennium 2016–2017 shall be calculated by multiplying the scale of fees for that Party, as 
contained in the annex, by the budget for the international transaction log for the biennium 
2016–2017, with the fees for the first year of the biennium being equal to the fees  for the 
second year of the biennium; 

3. 
Requests  the  Executive  Secretary  to  notify  Parties  connected  to  the  international 
transaction  log  in  the  biennium  2016–2017  of  the  annual  fees,  calculated  in  accordance 
with  paragraph  2  above,  as  early  as  possible  and  at  least  four  months  in  advance  of  the 
relevant calendar year, where possible; 

4. 
Decides that, if a Party connects to the international transaction log for the first time 
or  reconnects  to  it  following  disconnection  during  the  biennium  2016–2017,  the  scale  of 
fees for that Party shall be that contained in the annex, or, for Parties not listed in the table 
contained in the annex, shall be made equal to 130 per cent of their Kyoto Protocol adjusted 
scale for the relevant biennium; 

Also decides that fees paid by a Party that connects to the international transaction 
5. 
log for the first time shall be deducted from the resource requirement for activities relating 
to the international transaction log in the next biennium; 

6. 
Further  decides  that  fees  paid  by  a  Party  that  connects  to  the  international 
transaction  log  for  the  first  time  or,  following  disconnection,  reconnects  to  it  during  the 
biennium 2016–2017, shall be proportioned for the period between the date of connection 
or reconnection of its registry and the end of the biennium, except for the period for which 
the fees were already paid; 

Decides that, where a Party disconnects during the biennium 2016–2017, the Party 
7. 
shall cover the fees for the full year in which the disconnection took place, and that, if the 
disconnection takes place in the first year of the biennium and the Party does not reconnect 
in the second year of the biennium, fees for the second year of the biennium shall not apply; 

8. 
Authorizes the  international transaction log administrator  to disconnect  the registry 
of a Party from the international transaction log in the event of the non-payment of its fees 
by  that  Party,  provided  that  such  disconnection  shall  not  be  effected  earlier  than  four 
months  after  the  beginning  of  the  relevant  calendar  year,  at  least  two  reminders  have 
already been given to the Party and consultations have taken place with the Party concerned 
prior to the final reminder;

FCCC/SBI/2015/10/Add.1 

9. 
Also  authorizes  the  Executive  Secretary  to  draw  up  funds  from  unspent  balances 
(carry-over) of the Trust Fund for the International Transaction Log from previous financial 
periods to cover the potential shortfall in fees due to the disconnection of Parties during the 
biennium 2016–2017; 

Requests  the  international  transaction  log  administrator  to  provide,  in  its  annual 

10. 
reports for 2016 and 2017, information on transactions of Kyoto Protocol units; 

Also requests the international transaction log administrator to publish, in its annual 
11. 
reports,  a  table  listing  the  scale  and  the  level  of  fees  and  the  status  of  payments  for  all 
Parties connected to the international transaction log.

  Draft decision -/CP.21 

  Terms of reference for the intermediate review of the Doha  

work programme on Article 6 of the Convention 

The Conference of the Parties, 

Recalling decision 15/CP.18, 

Recognizing  the  progress  made  by  Parties,  international  organizations  and  civil 
society in planning, coordinating and implementing activities relating to all the elements of 
Article  6  of  the  Convention  –  education,  training,  public  awareness,  public  participation, 
public access to information, and international cooperation on these matters, 

Also recognizing that ensuring the availability of  sufficient financial and technical 
resources continues to be a challenge for the implementation of Article 6 of the Convention 
for Parties, in particular African countries, the  least developed countries and small island 
developing States, 

Reaffirming  the  importance  of  taking  into  account  gender  aspects  and  the  need  to 
promote  the  effective  engagement  of  children,  youth,  the  elderly,  women,  persons  with 
disabilities, indigenous peoples, local communities and non-governmental organizations in 
activities related to Article 6 of the Convention, 

Re-emphasizing  the  importance  of  building  and  strengthening  the  skills  and 
capacities of national focal points for Article 6 of the Convention, including by continuing 
to  facilitate  a  regular  exchange  of  views,  good  practices  and  lessons  learned  through  the 
organization  of  workshops,  videoconferences  and  activities  at  the  international,  regional 
and national levels, 

Recalling  the  invitation  to  multilateral  and  bilateral  institutions  and  organizations, 
including operating entities of the Financial Mechanism of the Convention, as appropriate, 
to provide financial support for the activities relating to the implementation of Article 6 of 
the Convention, 

Also  recalling  the  Lima  Ministerial  Declaration  on  Education  and  Awareness-
raising,1  which  stresses  that  education,  training,  public  awareness,  public  participation, 
public access to information, knowledge and international cooperation play a fundamental 
role in meeting the ultimate objective of the Convention and in promoting climate-resilient 
sustainable development, 

1. 
Requests the Subsidiary Body for Implementation to launch the intermediate review 
of the implementation of the Doha work programme on Article 6 of the Convention at its 
forty-fourth  session  (May  2016)  on  the  basis  of  the  terms  of  reference  contained  in  the 
annex, with a view to the review being completed by December 2016; 

2. 
Encourages  United Nations organizations, in particular the  members of the United 
Nations Alliance on Climate Change Education, Training and Public Awareness, to submit 
information  on  the  results  of  their  activities,  including  reports  from  relevant  regional  and 
subregional workshops, as appropriate, in order to support the implementation of the Doha 
work programme; 

3. 
Requests  the  Global  Environment  Facility  to  report  on  the  progress  made  in 
providing financial support and implementing activities to contribute to the implementation 
of the Doha work programme;

4. 
Invites multilateral and bilateral institutions and organizations, the private sector and 
donors  to  report  on  financial  resources  provided  to  support  the  activities  relating  to  the 
implementation of Article 6 of the Convention; 

5. 

Requests the secretariat: 

(a) 

To prepare a report on the progress made, as well as emerging gaps, needs, 
and recommendations by Parties, admitted observer organizations and other stakeholders in 
implementing the Doha  work programme as input to the intermediate review, as specified 
in  paragraph  5  of  the  terms  of  reference  contained  in  the  annex,  for  consideration  by  the 
Subsidiary Body for Implementation at its forty-fourth session; 

(b) 

To  continue  facilitating  a  regular  exchange  of  views,  good  practices  and 

lessons learned among national focal points for Article 6 of the Convention; 

(c) 

To  continue  collaborating  with  admitted  observer  organizations  and  other 
stakeholders  and  the  members  of  the  United  Nations  Alliance  on  Climate  Change 
Education,  Training  and  Public  Awareness  so  as  to  catalyse  action  on  Article  6  of  the 
Convention; 

Also  requests  that  the  actions  of  the  secretariat  called  for  in  this  decision  be

Annex 

Terms of reference for the intermediate review of the progress made in 
the implementation of the Doha work programme on Article 6 of the 
Convention 

I.  Mandate 

1. 
At its eighteenth session, the Conference of the Parties (COP) adopted the eight-year 
Doha  work  programme  on  Article  6  of  the  Convention  and  decided  that  it  would  be 
reviewed  in  2020,  with  an  intermediate  review  of  progress  in  2016,  to  evaluate  its 
effectiveness,  identify  any  emerging  gaps  and  needs,  and  inform  any  decisions  on 
improving the effectiveness of the work programme, as appropriate.1 

2. 
By  the  same  decision,  the  COP  requested  the  secretariat  to  prepare  reports  on  the 
progress  made  by  Parties  in  implementing  Article  6  of  the  Convention  based  on 
information  contained  in  national  communications,  reports  on  the  annual  in-session 
Dialogue  on  Article  6  and  other  sources  of  information,  including  a  report  on  good 
practices  of  stakeholder  participation  in  implementing  Article  6  activities.2  These  reports 
will be issued regularly and in particular for the intermediate progress review in 2016 and 
the review in 2020. 

II.  Objectives 

3.  With a view to encouraging improvement based on experience, the objectives of the 
intermediate  review  of  the  progress  made  in  the  implementation  of  the  Doha  work 
programme are: 

(a) 

To take stock of the progress made in the implementation of the Doha work 

programme to date, noting that this work is still ongoing; 

(b) 

To take stock of progress in the integration of Article 6 activities into existing

Draft decision -/CMP.11 

Methodology for the collection of international transaction 
log fees in the biennium 2016–2017 

The  Conference  of  the  Parties  serving  as  the  meeting  of  the  Parties  to  the  Kyoto 

Protocol, 

Recalling Article 13, paragraph 5, of the Kyoto Protocol, 

Also recalling decisions 11/CMP.3, 10/CMP.5, 9/CMP.6 and 8/CMP.8, 

Recognizing  the  importance  of  sufficient  and  stable  funding  for  the  international 

transaction log, 

Adopts the scale of fees for the international transaction log for the biennium 2016–

1. 
2017 contained in the annex; 

2. 
Decides  that  fees  for  the  international  transaction  log  paid  by  a  Party  for  the 
biennium 2016–2017 shall be calculated by multiplying the scale of fees for that Party, as 
contained in the annex, by the budget for the international transaction log for the biennium 
2016–2017, with the fees for the first year of the biennium being equal to the fees  for the 
second year of the biennium; 

3. 
Requests  the  Executive  Secretary  to  notify  Parties  connected  to  the  international 
transaction  log  in  the  biennium  2016–2017  of  the  annual  fees,  calculated  in  accordance 
with  paragraph  2  above,  as  early  as  possible  and  at  least  four  months  in  advance  of  the 
relevant calendar year, where possible; 

4. 
Decides that, if a Party connects to the international transaction log for the first time 
or  reconnects  to  it  following  disconnection  during  the  biennium  2016–2017,  the  scale  of 
fees for that Party shall be that contained in the annex, or, for Parties not listed in the table 
contained in the annex, shall be made equal to 130 per cent of their Kyoto Protocol adjusted 
scale for the relevant biennium; 

Also decides that fees paid by a Party that connects to the international transaction 
5. 
log for the first time shall be deducted from the resource requirement for activities relating 
to the international transaction log in the next biennium; 

6. 
Further  decides  that  fees  paid  by  a  Party  that  connects  to  the  international 
transaction  log  for  the  first  time  or,  following  disconnection,  reconnects  to  it  during  the 
biennium 2016–2017, shall be proportioned for the period between the date of connection 
or reconnection of its registry and the end of the biennium, except for the period for which 
the fees were already paid; 

Decides that, where a Party disconnects during the biennium 2016–2017, the Party 
7. 
shall cover the fees for the full year in which the disconnection took place, and that, if the 
disconnection takes place in the first year of the biennium and the Party does not reconnect 
in the second year of the biennium, fees for the second year of the biennium shall not apply; 

8. 
Authorizes the  international transaction log administrator  to disconnect  the registry 
of a Party from the international transaction log in the event of the non-payment of its fees 
by  that  Party,  provided  that  such  disconnection  shall  not  be  effected  earlier  than  four 
months  after  the  beginning  of  the  relevant  calendar  year,  at  least  two  reminders  have 
already been given to the Party and consultations have taken place with the Party concerned 
prior to the final reminder; 

27 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
FCCC/SBI/2015/10/Add.1 

9. 
Also  authorizes  the  Executive  Secretary  to  draw  up  funds  from  unspent  balances 
(carry-over) of the Trust Fund for the International Transaction Log from previous financial 
periods to cover the potential shortfall in fees due to the disconnection of Parties during the 
biennium 2016–2017; 

Requests  the  international  transaction  log  administrator  to  provide,  in  its  annual 

10. 
reports for 2016 and 2017, information on transactions of Kyoto Protocol units; 

Also requests the international transaction log administrator to publish, in its annual 
11. 
reports,  a  table  listing  the  scale  and  the  level  of  fees  and  the  status  of  payments  for  all 
Parties connected to the international transaction log.

society in planning, coordinating and implementing activities relating to all the elements of 
Article  6  of  the  Convention  –  education,  training,  public  awareness,  public  participation, 
public access to information, and international cooperation on these matters, 

Also recognizing that ensuring the availability of  sufficient financial and technical 
resources continues to be a challenge for the implementation of Article 6 of the Convention 
for Parties, in particular African countries, the  least developed countries and small island 
developing States, 

Reaffirming  the  importance  of  taking  into  account  gender  aspects  and  the  need  to 
promote  the  effective  engagement  of  children,  youth,  the  elderly,  women,  persons  with 
disabilities, indigenous peoples, local communities and non-governmental organizations in 
activities related to Article 6 of the Convention, 

Re-emphasizing  the  importance  of  building  and  strengthening  the  skills  and 
capacities of national focal points for Article 6 of the Convention, including by continuing 
to  facilitate  a  regular  exchange  of  views,  good  practices  and  lessons  learned  through  the 
organization  of  workshops,  videoconferences  and  activities  at  the  international,  regional 
and national levels, 

Recalling  the  invitation  to  multilateral  and  bilateral  institutions  and  organizations, 
including operating entities of the Financial Mechanism of the Convention, as appropriate, 
to provide financial support for the activities relating to the implementation of Article 6 of 
the Convention, 

Also  recalling  the  Lima  Ministerial  Declaration  on  Education  and  Awareness-
raising,1  which  stresses  that  education,  training,  public  awareness,  public  participation, 
public access to information, knowledge and international cooperation play a fundamental 
role in meeting the ultimate objective of the Convention and in promoting climate-resilient 
sustainable development, 

1. 
Requests the Subsidiary Body for Implementation to launch the intermediate review 
of the implementation of the Doha work programme on Article 6 of the Convention at its 
forty-fourth  session  (May  2016)  on  the  basis  of  the  terms  of  reference  contained  in  the 
annex, with a view to the review being completed by December 2016; 

2. 
Encourages  United Nations organizations, in particular the  members of the United 
Nations Alliance on Climate Change Education, Training and Public Awareness, to submit 
information  on  the  results  of  their  activities,  including  reports  from  relevant  regional  and 
subregional workshops, as appropriate, in order to support the implementation of the Doha 
work programme; 

3. 
Requests  the  Global  Environment  Facility  to  report  on  the  progress  made  in 
providing financial support and implementing activities to contribute to the implementation 
of the Doha work programme;

To  continue  facilitating  a  regular  exchange  of  views,  good  practices  and 

lessons learned among national focal points for Article 6 of the Convention;

Draft decision -/CMP.11 

Methodology for the collection of international transaction 
log fees in the biennium 2016–2017 

The  Conference  of  the  Parties  serving  as  the  meeting  of  the  Parties  to  the  Kyoto 

Protocol, 

Recalling Article 13, paragraph 5, of the Kyoto Protocol, 

Also recalling decisions 11/CMP.3, 10/CMP.5, 9/CMP.6 and 8/CMP.8, 

Recognizing  the  importance  of  sufficient  and  stable  funding  for  the  international 

transaction log, 

Adopts the scale of fees for the international transaction log for the biennium 2016–

1. 
2017 contained in the annex; 

2. 
Decides  that  fees  for  the  international  transaction  log  paid  by  a  Party  for  the 
biennium 2016–2017 shall be calculated by multiplying the scale of fees for that Party, as 
contained in the annex, by the budget for the international transaction log for the biennium 
2016–2017, with the fees for the first year of the biennium being equal to the fees  for the 
second year of the biennium;

and national levels, 

Recalling  the  invitation  to  multilateral  and  bilateral  institutions  and  organizations, 
including operating entities of the Financial Mechanism of the Convention, as appropriate, 
to provide financial support for the activities relating to the implementation of Article 6 of 
the Convention, 

Also  recalling  the  Lima  Ministerial  Declaration  on  Education  and  Awareness-
raising,1  which  stresses  that  education,  training,  public  awareness,  public  participation, 
public access to information, knowledge and international cooperation play a fundamental 
role in meeting the ultimate objective of the Convention and in promoting climate-resilient 
sustainable development, 

1. 
Requests the Subsidiary Body for Implementation to launch the intermediate review 
of the implementation of the Doha work programme on Article 6 of the Convention at its

Note: Assumptions used for calculating the conference services contingency budget include the following: 
  The expected number of meetings with interpretation does not exceed 40 per session; 
  The expected documentation volume is based on the calculations provided by the United Nations Office at Geneva; 
  Meetings services support includes staff normally provided by the United Nations Office at Geneva conference services for 

the in-session coordination and support of interpretation, translation and reproduction services; 

  Overall, the figures used are conservative and have been applied on the assumption that there will be no major increase in 

requirements during the biennium.  

a   Includes salaries, travel and daily subsistence allowance for interpreters. 
b   Includes all costs related to the processing of pre-, in- and post-session documentation; translation costs include revision and 

typing of documents.

Draft decision -/CMP.11 

Methodology for the collection of international transaction 
log fees in the biennium 2016–2017 

The  Conference  of  the  Parties  serving  as  the  meeting  of  the  Parties  to  the  Kyoto 

Protocol, 

Recalling Article 13, paragraph 5, of the Kyoto Protocol, 

Also recalling decisions 11/CMP.3, 10/CMP.5, 9/CMP.6 and 8/CMP.8, 

Recognizing  the  importance  of  sufficient  and  stable  funding  for  the  international 

transaction log, 

Adopts the scale of fees for the international transaction log for the biennium 2016–

1. 
2017 contained in the annex; 

2. 
Decides  that  fees  for  the  international  transaction  log  paid  by  a  Party  for  the 
biennium 2016–2017 shall be calculated by multiplying the scale of fees for that Party, as 
contained in the annex, by the budget for the international transaction log for the biennium 
2016–2017, with the fees for the first year of the biennium being equal to the fees  for the 
second year of the biennium; 

3. 
Requests  the  Executive  Secretary  to  notify  Parties  connected  to  the  international 
transaction  log  in  the  biennium  2016–2017  of  the  annual  fees,  calculated  in  accordance 
with  paragraph  2  above,  as  early  as  possible  and  at  least  four  months  in  advance  of  the 
relevant calendar year, where possible; 

4. 
Decides that, if a Party connects to the international transaction log for the first time 
or  reconnects  to  it  following  disconnection  during  the  biennium  2016–2017,  the  scale  of 
fees for that Party shall be that contained in the annex, or, for Parties not listed in the table 
contained in the annex, shall be made equal to 130 per cent of their Kyoto Protocol adjusted 
scale for the relevant biennium; 

Also decides that fees paid by a Party that connects to the international transaction 
5. 
log for the first time shall be deducted from the resource requirement for activities relating 
to the international transaction log in the next biennium; 

6. 
Further  decides  that  fees  paid  by  a  Party  that  connects  to  the  international 
transaction  log  for  the  first  time  or,  following  disconnection,  reconnects  to  it  during  the 
biennium 2016–2017, shall be proportioned for the period between the date of connection 
or reconnection of its registry and the end of the biennium, except for the period for which 
the fees were already paid; 

Decides that, where a Party disconnects during the biennium 2016–2017, the Party 
7. 
shall cover the fees for the full year in which the disconnection took place, and that, if the 
disconnection takes place in the first year of the biennium and the Party does not reconnect 
in the second year of the biennium, fees for the second year of the biennium shall not apply; 

8. 
Authorizes the  international transaction log administrator  to disconnect  the registry 
of a Party from the international transaction log in the event of the non-payment of its fees 
by  that  Party,  provided  that  such  disconnection  shall  not  be  effected  earlier  than  four 
months  after  the  beginning  of  the  relevant  calendar  year,  at  least  two  reminders  have 
already been given to the Party and consultations have taken place with the Party concerned 
prior to the final reminder;

FCCC/SBI/2015/10/Add.1 

9. 
Also  authorizes  the  Executive  Secretary  to  draw  up  funds  from  unspent  balances 
(carry-over) of the Trust Fund for the International Transaction Log from previous financial 
periods to cover the potential shortfall in fees due to the disconnection of Parties during the 
biennium 2016–2017; 

Requests  the  international  transaction  log  administrator  to  provide,  in  its  annual 

10. 
reports for 2016 and 2017, information on transactions of Kyoto Protocol units; 

Also requests the international transaction log administrator to publish, in its annual 
11. 
reports,  a  table  listing  the  scale  and  the  level  of  fees  and  the  status  of  payments  for  all 
Parties connected to the international transaction log.

Note: Assumptions used for calculating the conference services contingency budget include the following: 
  The expected number of meetings with interpretation does not exceed 40 per session; 
  The expected documentation volume is based on the calculations provided by the United Nations Office at Geneva; 
  Meetings services support includes staff normally provided by the United Nations Office at Geneva conference services for 

the in-session coordination and support of interpretation, translation and reproduction services; 

  Overall, the figures used are conservative and have been applied on the assumption that there will be no major increase in 

requirements during the biennium.  

a   Includes salaries, travel and daily subsistence allowance for interpreters. 
b   Includes all costs related to the processing of pre-, in- and post-session documentation; translation costs include revision and 

typing of documents. 

c   Includes salaries, travel and daily subsistence allowance for meetings services support staff and costs of shipment and 

telecommunications.

Draft decision -/CMP.11 

Methodology for the collection of international transaction 
log fees in the biennium 2016–2017 

The  Conference  of  the  Parties  serving  as  the  meeting  of  the  Parties  to  the  Kyoto 

Protocol, 

Recalling Article 13, paragraph 5, of the Kyoto Protocol, 

Also recalling decisions 11/CMP.3, 10/CMP.5, 9/CMP.6 and 8/CMP.8, 

Recognizing  the  importance  of  sufficient  and  stable  funding  for  the  international 

transaction log, 

Adopts the scale of fees for the international transaction log for the biennium 2016–

1. 
2017 contained in the annex; 

2. 
Decides  that  fees  for  the  international  transaction  log  paid  by  a  Party  for  the 
biennium 2016–2017 shall be calculated by multiplying the scale of fees for that Party, as 
contained in the annex, by the budget for the international transaction log for the biennium 
2016–2017, with the fees for the first year of the biennium being equal to the fees  for the 
second year of the biennium; 

3. 
Requests  the  Executive  Secretary  to  notify  Parties  connected  to  the  international 
transaction  log  in  the  biennium  2016–2017  of  the  annual  fees,  calculated  in  accordance 
with  paragraph  2  above,  as  early  as  possible  and  at  least  four  months  in  advance  of  the 
relevant calendar year, where possible; 

4. 
Decides that, if a Party connects to the international transaction log for the first time 
or  reconnects  to  it  following  disconnection  during  the  biennium  2016–2017,  the  scale  of 
fees for that Party shall be that contained in the annex, or, for Parties not listed in the table 
contained in the annex, shall be made equal to 130 per cent of their Kyoto Protocol adjusted 
scale for the relevant biennium; 

Also decides that fees paid by a Party that connects to the international transaction 
5. 
log for the first time shall be deducted from the resource requirement for activities relating 
to the international transaction log in the next biennium; 

6. 
Further  decides  that  fees  paid  by  a  Party  that  connects  to  the  international 
transaction  log  for  the  first  time  or,  following  disconnection,  reconnects  to  it  during  the 
biennium 2016–2017, shall be proportioned for the period between the date of connection 
or reconnection of its registry and the end of the biennium, except for the period for which 
the fees were already paid; 

Decides that, where a Party disconnects during the biennium 2016–2017, the Party 
7. 
shall cover the fees for the full year in which the disconnection took place, and that, if the 
disconnection takes place in the first year of the biennium and the Party does not reconnect 
in the second year of the biennium, fees for the second year of the biennium shall not apply; 

8. 
Authorizes the  international transaction log administrator  to disconnect  the registry 
of a Party from the international transaction log in the event of the non-payment of its fees 
by  that  Party,  provided  that  such  disconnection  shall  not  be  effected  earlier  than  four 
months  after  the  beginning  of  the  relevant  calendar  year,  at  least  two  reminders  have 
already been given to the Party and consultations have taken place with the Party concerned 
prior to the final reminder;

FCCC/SBI/2015/10/Add.1 

9. 
Also  authorizes  the  Executive  Secretary  to  draw  up  funds  from  unspent  balances 
(carry-over) of the Trust Fund for the International Transaction Log from previous financial 
periods to cover the potential shortfall in fees due to the disconnection of Parties during the 
biennium 2016–2017; 

Requests  the  international  transaction  log  administrator  to  provide,  in  its  annual 

10. 
reports for 2016 and 2017, information on transactions of Kyoto Protocol units; 

Also requests the international transaction log administrator to publish, in its annual 
11. 
reports,  a  table  listing  the  scale  and  the  level  of  fees  and  the  status  of  payments  for  all 
Parties connected to the international transaction log.

  Draft decision -/CP.21 

  Terms of reference for the intermediate review of the Doha  

work programme on Article 6 of the Convention 

The Conference of the Parties, 

Recalling decision 15/CP.18, 

Recognizing  the  progress  made  by  Parties,  international  organizations  and  civil 
society in planning, coordinating and implementing activities relating to all the elements of 
Article  6  of  the  Convention  –  education,  training,  public  awareness,  public  participation, 
public access to information, and international cooperation on these matters, 

Also recognizing that ensuring the availability of  sufficient financial and technical 
resources continues to be a challenge for the implementation of Article 6 of the Convention 
for Parties, in particular African countries, the  least developed countries and small island 
developing States, 

Reaffirming  the  importance  of  taking  into  account  gender  aspects  and  the  need  to 
promote  the  effective  engagement  of  children,  youth,  the  elderly,  women,  persons  with 
disabilities, indigenous peoples, local communities and non-governmental organizations in 
activities related to Article 6 of the Convention, 

Re-emphasizing  the  importance  of  building  and  strengthening  the  skills  and 
capacities of national focal points for Article 6 of the Convention, including by continuing 
to  facilitate  a  regular  exchange  of  views,  good  practices  and  lessons  learned  through  the 
organization  of  workshops,  videoconferences  and  activities  at  the  international,  regional 
and national levels, 

Recalling  the  invitation  to  multilateral  and  bilateral  institutions  and  organizations, 
including operating entities of the Financial Mechanism of the Convention, as appropriate, 
to provide financial support for the activities relating to the implementation of Article 6 of 
the Convention, 

Also  recalling  the  Lima  Ministerial  Declaration  on  Education  and  Awareness-
raising,1  which  stresses  that  education,  training,  public  awareness,  public  participation, 
public access to information, knowledge and international cooperation play a fundamental 
role in meeting the ultimate objective of the Convention and in promoting climate-resilient 
sustainable development, 

1. 
Requests the Subsidiary Body for Implementation to launch the intermediate review 
of the implementation of the Doha work programme on Article 6 of the Convention at its 
forty-fourth  session  (May  2016)  on  the  basis  of  the  terms  of  reference  contained  in  the 
annex, with a view to the review being completed by December 2016; 

2. 
Encourages  United Nations organizations, in particular the  members of the United 
Nations Alliance on Climate Change Education, Training and Public Awareness, to submit 
information  on  the  results  of  their  activities,  including  reports  from  relevant  regional  and 
subregional workshops, as appropriate, in order to support the implementation of the Doha 
work programme; 

3. 
Requests  the  Global  Environment  Facility  to  report  on  the  progress  made  in 
providing financial support and implementing activities to contribute to the implementation 
of the Doha work programme;

4. 
Invites multilateral and bilateral institutions and organizations, the private sector and 
donors  to  report  on  financial  resources  provided  to  support  the  activities  relating  to  the 
implementation of Article 6 of the Convention; 

5. 

Requests the secretariat: 

(a) 

To prepare a report on the progress made, as well as emerging gaps, needs, 
and recommendations by Parties, admitted observer organizations and other stakeholders in 
implementing the Doha  work programme as input to the intermediate review, as specified 
in  paragraph  5  of  the  terms  of  reference  contained  in  the  annex,  for  consideration  by  the 
Subsidiary Body for Implementation at its forty-fourth session; 

(b) 

To  continue  facilitating  a  regular  exchange  of  views,  good  practices  and 

lessons learned among national focal points for Article 6 of the Convention; 

(c) 

To  continue  collaborating  with  admitted  observer  organizations  and  other 
stakeholders  and  the  members  of  the  United  Nations  Alliance  on  Climate  Change 
Education,  Training  and  Public  Awareness  so  as  to  catalyse  action  on  Article  6  of  the 
Convention; 

Also  requests  that  the  actions  of  the  secretariat  called  for  in  this  decision  be

Annex 

Terms of reference for the intermediate review of the progress made in 
the implementation of the Doha work programme on Article 6 of the 
Convention 

I.  Mandate 

1. 
At its eighteenth session, the Conference of the Parties (COP) adopted the eight-year 
Doha  work  programme  on  Article  6  of  the  Convention  and  decided  that  it  would  be 
reviewed  in  2020,  with  an  intermediate  review  of  progress  in  2016,  to  evaluate  its 
effectiveness,  identify  any  emerging  gaps  and  needs,  and  inform  any  decisions  on 
improving the effectiveness of the work programme, as appropriate.1 

2. 
By  the  same  decision,  the  COP  requested  the  secretariat  to  prepare  reports  on  the 
progress  made  by  Parties  in  implementing  Article  6  of  the  Convention  based  on 
information  contained  in  national  communications,  reports  on  the  annual  in-session 
Dialogue  on  Article  6  and  other  sources  of  information,  including  a  report  on  good 
practices  of  stakeholder  participation  in  implementing  Article  6  activities.2  These  reports 
will be issued regularly and in particular for the intermediate progress review in 2016 and 
the review in 2020. 

II.  Objectives 

3.  With a view to encouraging improvement based on experience, the objectives of the 
intermediate  review  of  the  progress  made  in  the  implementation  of  the  Doha  work 
programme are:

programme to date, noting that this work is still ongoing; 

(b) 

To take stock of progress in the integration of Article 6 activities into existing 

climate change adaptation and mitigation programmes, strategies and activities; 

(c)

Draft decision -/CMP.11 

Methodology for the collection of international transaction 
log fees in the biennium 2016–2017 

The  Conference  of  the  Parties  serving  as  the  meeting  of  the  Parties  to  the  Kyoto 

Protocol, 

Recalling Article 13, paragraph 5, of the Kyoto Protocol, 

Also recalling decisions 11/CMP.3, 10/CMP.5, 9/CMP.6 and 8/CMP.8, 

Recognizing  the  importance  of  sufficient  and  stable  funding  for  the  international 

transaction log, 

Adopts the scale of fees for the international transaction log for the biennium 2016–

1. 
2017 contained in the annex; 

2. 
Decides  that  fees  for  the  international  transaction  log  paid  by  a  Party  for  the 
biennium 2016–2017 shall be calculated by multiplying the scale of fees for that Party, as 
contained in the annex, by the budget for the international transaction log for the biennium 
2016–2017, with the fees for the first year of the biennium being equal to the fees  for the 
second year of the biennium; 

3. 
Requests  the  Executive  Secretary  to  notify  Parties  connected  to  the  international 
transaction  log  in  the  biennium  2016–2017  of  the  annual  fees,  calculated  in  accordance 
with  paragraph  2  above,  as  early  as  possible  and  at  least  four  months  in  advance  of  the 
relevant calendar year, where possible; 

4. 
Decides that, if a Party connects to the international transaction log for the first time 
or  reconnects  to  it  following  disconnection  during  the  biennium  2016–2017,  the  scale  of 
fees for that Party shall be that contained in the annex, or, for Parties not listed in the table 
contained in the annex, shall be made equal to 130 per cent of their Kyoto Protocol adjusted 
scale for the relevant biennium; 

Also decides that fees paid by a Party that connects to the international transaction 
5. 
log for the first time shall be deducted from the resource requirement for activities relating 
to the international transaction log in the next biennium; 

6. 
Further  decides  that  fees  paid  by  a  Party  that  connects  to  the  international 
transaction  log  for  the  first  time  or,  following  disconnection,  reconnects  to  it  during  the 
biennium 2016–2017, shall be proportioned for the period between the date of connection 
or reconnection of its registry and the end of the biennium, except for the period for which 
the fees were already paid; 

Decides that, where a Party disconnects during the biennium 2016–2017, the Party 
7. 
shall cover the fees for the full year in which the disconnection took place, and that, if the 
disconnection takes place in the first year of the biennium and the Party does not reconnect 
in the second year of the biennium, fees for the second year of the biennium shall not apply; 

8. 
Authorizes the  international transaction log administrator  to disconnect  the registry 
of a Party from the international transaction log in the event of the non-payment of its fees 
by  that  Party,  provided  that  such  disconnection  shall  not  be  effected  earlier  than  four 
months  after  the  beginning  of  the  relevant  calendar  year,  at  least  two  reminders  have 
already been given to the Party and consultations have taken place with the Party concerned 
prior to the final reminder; 

27 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
FCCC/SBI/2015/10/Add.1 

9. 
Also  authorizes  the  Executive  Secretary  to  draw  up  funds  from  unspent  balances 
(carry-over) of the Trust Fund for the International Transaction Log from previous financial 
periods to cover the potential shortfall in fees due to the disconnection of Parties during the 
biennium 2016–2017; 

Requests  the  international  transaction  log  administrator  to  provide,  in  its  annual 

10. 
reports for 2016 and 2017, information on transactions of Kyoto Protocol units; 

Also requests the international transaction log administrator to publish, in its annual 
11. 
reports,  a  table  listing  the  scale  and  the  level  of  fees  and  the  status  of  payments  for  all 
Parties connected to the international transaction log.

society in planning, coordinating and implementing activities relating to all the elements of 
Article  6  of  the  Convention  –  education,  training,  public  awareness,  public  participation, 
public access to information, and international cooperation on these matters, 

Also recognizing that ensuring the availability of  sufficient financial and technical 
resources continues to be a challenge for the implementation of Article 6 of the Convention 
for Parties, in particular African countries, the  least developed countries and small island 
developing States, 

Reaffirming  the  importance  of  taking  into  account  gender  aspects  and  the  need  to 
promote  the  effective  engagement  of  children,  youth,  the  elderly,  women,  persons  with 
disabilities, indigenous peoples, local communities and non-governmental organizations in 
activities related to Article 6 of the Convention, 

Re-emphasizing  the  importance  of  building  and  strengthening  the  skills  and 
capacities of national focal points for Article 6 of the Convention, including by continuing 
to  facilitate  a  regular  exchange  of  views,  good  practices  and  lessons  learned  through  the 
organization  of  workshops,  videoconferences  and  activities  at  the  international,  regional 
and national levels, 

Recalling  the  invitation  to  multilateral  and  bilateral  institutions  and  organizations, 
including operating entities of the Financial Mechanism of the Convention, as appropriate, 
to provide financial support for the activities relating to the implementation of Article 6 of 
the Convention, 

Also  recalling  the  Lima  Ministerial  Declaration  on  Education  and  Awareness-
raising,1  which  stresses  that  education,  training,  public  awareness,  public  participation, 
public access to information, knowledge and international cooperation play a fundamental 
role in meeting the ultimate objective of the Convention and in promoting climate-resilient 
sustainable development, 

1. 
Requests the Subsidiary Body for Implementation to launch the intermediate review 
of the implementation of the Doha work programme on Article 6 of the Convention at its 
forty-fourth  session  (May  2016)  on  the  basis  of  the  terms  of  reference  contained  in  the 
annex, with a view to the review being completed by December 2016; 

2. 
Encourages  United Nations organizations, in particular the  members of the United 
Nations Alliance on Climate Change Education, Training and Public Awareness, to submit 
information  on  the  results  of  their  activities,  including  reports  from  relevant  regional  and 
subregional workshops, as appropriate, in order to support the implementation of the Doha 
work programme; 

3. 
Requests  the  Global  Environment  Facility  to  report  on  the  progress  made  in 
providing financial support and implementing activities to contribute to the implementation 
of the Doha work programme;

To  continue  facilitating  a  regular  exchange  of  views,  good  practices  and 

lessons learned among national focal points for Article 6 of the Convention;

Draft decision -/CMP.11 

Methodology for the collection of international transaction 
log fees in the biennium 2016–2017 

The  Conference  of  the  Parties  serving  as  the  meeting  of  the  Parties  to  the  Kyoto 

Protocol, 

Recalling Article 13, paragraph 5, of the Kyoto Protocol, 

Also recalling decisions 11/CMP.3, 10/CMP.5, 9/CMP.6 and 8/CMP.8, 

Recognizing  the  importance  of  sufficient  and  stable  funding  for  the  international 

transaction log, 

Adopts the scale of fees for the international transaction log for the biennium 2016–

1. 
2017 contained in the annex; 

2. 
Decides  that  fees  for  the  international  transaction  log  paid  by  a  Party  for  the 
biennium 2016–2017 shall be calculated by multiplying the scale of fees for that Party, as 
contained in the annex, by the budget for the international transaction log for the biennium 
2016–2017, with the fees for the first year of the biennium being equal to the fees  for the 
second year of the biennium; 

3. 
Requests  the  Executive  Secretary  to  notify  Parties  connected  to  the  international 
transaction  log  in  the  biennium  2016–2017  of  the  annual  fees,  calculated  in  accordance 
with  paragraph  2  above,  as  early  as  possible  and  at  least  four  months  in  advance  of  the 
relevant calendar year, where possible; 

4. 
Decides that, if a Party connects to the international transaction log for the first time 
or  reconnects  to  it  following  disconnection  during  the  biennium  2016–2017,  the  scale  of 
fees for that Party shall be that contained in the annex, or, for Parties not listed in the table 
contained in the annex, shall be made equal to 130 per cent of their Kyoto Protocol adjusted 
scale for the relevant biennium; 

Also decides that fees paid by a Party that connects to the international transaction 
5. 
log for the first time shall be deducted from the resource requirement for activities relating

and national levels, 

Recalling  the  invitation  to  multilateral  and  bilateral  institutions  and  organizations, 
including operating entities of the Financial Mechanism of the Convention, as appropriate, 
to provide financial support for the activities relating to the implementation of Article 6 of

Also  recalling  the  Lima  Ministerial  Declaration  on  Education  and  Awareness-
raising,1  which  stresses  that  education,  training,  public  awareness,  public  participation, 
public access to information, knowledge and international cooperation play a fundamental 
role in meeting the ultimate objective of the Convention and in promoting climate-resilient 
sustainable development, 

1. 
Requests the Subsidiary Body for Implementation to launch the intermediate review 
of the implementation of the Doha work programme on Article 6 of the Convention at its

Note: Assumptions used for calculating the conference services contingency budget include the following: 
  The expected number of meetings with interpretation does not exceed 40 per session; 
  The expected documentation volume is based on the calculations provided by the United Nations Office at Geneva; 
  Meetings services support includes staff normally provided by the United Nations Office at Geneva conference services for 

the in-session coordination and support of interpretation, translation and reproduction services; 

  Overall, the figures used are conservative and have been applied on the assumption that there will be no major increase in 

requirements during the biennium.  

a   Includes salaries, travel and daily subsistence allowance for interpreters. 
b   Includes all costs related to the processing of pre-, in- and post-session documentation; translation costs include revision and 

typing of documents. 

c   Includes salaries, travel and daily subsistence allowance for meetings services support staff and costs of shipment and 

telecommunications.

Draft decision -/CMP.11 

Methodology for the collection of international transaction 
log fees in the biennium 2016–2017 

The  Conference  of  the  Parties  serving  as  the  meeting  of  the  Parties  to  the  Kyoto 

Protocol, 

Recalling Article 13, paragraph 5, of the Kyoto Protocol, 

Also recalling decisions 11/CMP.3, 10/CMP.5, 9/CMP.6 and 8/CMP.8, 

Recognizing  the  importance  of  sufficient  and  stable  funding  for  the  international 

transaction log, 

Adopts the scale of fees for the international transaction log for the biennium 2016–

1. 
2017 contained in the annex; 

2. 
Decides  that  fees  for  the  international  transaction  log  paid  by  a  Party  for  the 
biennium 2016–2017 shall be calculated by multiplying the scale of fees for that Party, as 
contained in the annex, by the budget for the international transaction log for the biennium 
2016–2017, with the fees for the first year of the biennium being equal to the fees  for the 
second year of the biennium; 

3. 
Requests  the  Executive  Secretary  to  notify  Parties  connected  to  the  international 
transaction  log  in  the  biennium  2016–2017  of  the  annual  fees,  calculated  in  accordance 
with  paragraph  2  above,  as  early  as  possible  and  at  least  four  months  in  advance  of  the 
relevant calendar year, where possible; 

4. 
Decides that, if a Party connects to the international transaction log for the first time 
or  reconnects  to  it  following  disconnection  during  the  biennium  2016–2017,  the  scale  of 
fees for that Party shall be that contained in the annex, or, for Parties not listed in the table 
contained in the annex, shall be made equal to 130 per cent of their Kyoto Protocol adjusted 
scale for the relevant biennium; 

Also decides that fees paid by a Party that connects to the international transaction 
5. 
log for the first time shall be deducted from the resource requirement for activities relating 
to the international transaction log in the next biennium; 

6. 
Further  decides  that  fees  paid  by  a  Party  that  connects  to  the  international 
transaction  log  for  the  first  time  or,  following  disconnection,  reconnects  to  it  during  the 
biennium 2016–2017, shall be proportioned for the period between the date of connection 
or reconnection of its registry and the end of the biennium, except for the period for which 
the fees were already paid; 

Decides that, where a Party disconnects during the biennium 2016–2017, the Party 
7. 
shall cover the fees for the full year in which the disconnection took place, and that, if the 
disconnection takes place in the first year of the biennium and the Party does not reconnect 
in the second year of the biennium, fees for the second year of the biennium shall not apply; 

8. 
Authorizes the  international transaction log administrator  to disconnect  the registry 
of a Party from the international transaction log in the event of the non-payment of its fees 
by  that  Party,  provided  that  such  disconnection  shall  not  be  effected  earlier  than  four 
months  after  the  beginning  of  the  relevant  calendar  year,  at  least  two  reminders  have 
already been given to the Party and consultations have taken place with the Party concerned 
prior to the final reminder;

FCCC/SBI/2015/10/Add.1 

9. 
Also  authorizes  the  Executive  Secretary  to  draw  up  funds  from  unspent  balances 
(carry-over) of the Trust Fund for the International Transaction Log from previous financial 
periods to cover the potential shortfall in fees due to the disconnection of Parties during the 
biennium 2016–2017; 

Requests  the  international  transaction  log  administrator  to  provide,  in  its  annual 

10. 
reports for 2016 and 2017, information on transactions of Kyoto Protocol units; 

Also requests the international transaction log administrator to publish, in its annual 
11. 
reports,  a  table  listing  the  scale  and  the  level  of  fees  and  the  status  of  payments  for  all 
Parties connected to the international transaction log.

  Terms of reference for the intermediate review of the Doha  

work programme on Article 6 of the Convention 

The Conference of the Parties, 

Recalling decision 15/CP.18, 

Recognizing  the  progress  made  by  Parties,  international  organizations  and  civil 
society in planning, coordinating and implementing activities relating to all the elements of 
Article  6  of  the  Convention  –  education,  training,  public  awareness,  public  participation, 
public access to information, and international cooperation on these matters,

Note: Assumptions used for calculating the conference services contingency budget include the following: 
  The expected number of meetings with interpretation does not exceed 40 per session; 
  The expected documentation volume is based on the calculations provided by the United Nations Office at Geneva; 
  Meetings services support includes staff normally provided by the United Nations Office at Geneva conference services for 

the in-session coordination and support of interpretation, translation and reproduction services; 

  Overall, the figures used are conservative and have been applied on the assumption that there will be no major increase in 

requirements during the biennium.  

a   Includes salaries, travel and daily subsistence allowance for interpreters. 
b   Includes all costs related to the processing of pre-, in- and post-session documentation; translation costs include revision and 

typing of documents. 

c   Includes salaries, travel and daily subsistence allowance for meetings services support staff and costs of shipment and 

telecommunications.

Draft decision -/CMP.11 

Methodology for the collection of international transaction 
log fees in the biennium 2016–2017 

The  Conference  of  the  Parties  serving  as  the  meeting  of  the  Parties  to  the  Kyoto 

Protocol, 

Recalling Article 13, paragraph 5, of the Kyoto Protocol, 

Also recalling decisions 11/CMP.3, 10/CMP.5, 9/CMP.6 and 8/CMP.8, 

Recognizing  the  importance  of  sufficient  and  stable  funding  for  the  international 

transaction log, 

Adopts the scale of fees for the international transaction log for the biennium 2016–

1. 
2017 contained in the annex; 

2. 
Decides  that  fees  for  the  international  transaction  log  paid  by  a  Party  for  the 
biennium 2016–2017 shall be calculated by multiplying the scale of fees for that Party, as 
contained in the annex, by the budget for the international transaction log for the biennium 
2016–2017, with the fees for the first year of the biennium being equal to the fees  for the 
second year of the biennium; 

3. 
Requests  the  Executive  Secretary  to  notify  Parties  connected  to  the  international 
transaction  log  in  the  biennium  2016–2017  of  the  annual  fees,  calculated  in  accordance 
with  paragraph  2  above,  as  early  as  possible  and  at  least  four  months  in  advance  of  the 
relevant calendar year, where possible; 

4. 
Decides that, if a Party connects to the international transaction log for the first time 
or  reconnects  to  it  following  disconnection  during  the  biennium  2016–2017,  the  scale  of 
fees for that Party shall be that contained in the annex, or, for Parties not listed in the table 
contained in the annex, shall be made equal to 130 per cent of their Kyoto Protocol adjusted 
scale for the relevant biennium; 

Also decides that fees paid by a Party that connects to the international transaction 
5. 
log for the first time shall be deducted from the resource requirement for activities relating 
to the international transaction log in the next biennium; 

6. 
Further  decides  that  fees  paid  by  a  Party  that  connects  to  the  international 
transaction  log  for  the  first  time  or,  following  disconnection,  reconnects  to  it  during  the 
biennium 2016–2017, shall be proportioned for the period between the date of connection 
or reconnection of its registry and the end of the biennium, except for the period for which 
the fees were already paid; 

Decides that, where a Party disconnects during the biennium 2016–2017, the Party 
7. 
shall cover the fees for the full year in which the disconnection took place, and that, if the 
disconnection takes place in the first year of the biennium and the Party does not reconnect 
in the second year of the biennium, fees for the second year of the biennium shall not apply; 

8. 
Authorizes the  international transaction log administrator  to disconnect  the registry 
of a Party from the international transaction log in the event of the non-payment of its fees 
by  that  Party,  provided  that  such  disconnection  shall  not  be  effected  earlier  than  four 
months  after  the  beginning  of  the  relevant  calendar  year,  at  least  two  reminders  have 
already been given to the Party and consultations have taken place with the Party concerned 
prior to the final reminder;

FCCC/SBI/2015/10/Add.1 

9. 
Also  authorizes  the  Executive  Secretary  to  draw  up  funds  from  unspent  balances 
(carry-over) of the Trust Fund for the International Transaction Log from previous financial 
periods to cover the potential shortfall in fees due to the disconnection of Parties during the 
biennium 2016–2017; 

Requests  the  international  transaction  log  administrator  to  provide,  in  its  annual 

10. 
reports for 2016 and 2017, information on transactions of Kyoto Protocol units; 

Also requests the international transaction log administrator to publish, in its annual 
11. 
reports,  a  table  listing  the  scale  and  the  level  of  fees  and  the  status  of  payments  for  all 
Parties connected to the international transaction log.

  Draft decision -/CP.21 

  Terms of reference for the intermediate review of the Doha  

work programme on Article 6 of the Convention 

The Conference of the Parties, 

Recalling decision 15/CP.18, 

Recognizing  the  progress  made  by  Parties,  international  organizations  and  civil 
society in planning, coordinating and implementing activities relating to all the elements of 
Article  6  of  the  Convention  –  education,  training,  public  awareness,  public  participation, 
public access to information, and international cooperation on these matters, 

Also recognizing that ensuring the availability of  sufficient financial and technical 
resources continues to be a challenge for the implementation of Article 6 of the Convention 
for Parties, in particular African countries, the  least developed countries and small island 
developing States, 

Reaffirming  the  importance  of  taking  into  account  gender  aspects  and  the  need  to 
promote  the  effective  engagement  of  children,  youth,  the  elderly,  women,  persons  with 
disabilities, indigenous peoples, local communities and non-governmental organizations in 
activities related to Article 6 of the Convention, 

Re-emphasizing  the  importance  of  building  and  strengthening  the  skills  and 
capacities of national focal points for Article 6 of the Convention, including by continuing 
to  facilitate  a  regular  exchange  of  views,  good  practices  and  lessons  learned  through  the 
organization  of  workshops,  videoconferences  and  activities  at  the  international,  regional 
and national levels, 

Recalling  the  invitation  to  multilateral  and  bilateral  institutions  and  organizations, 
including operating entities of the Financial Mechanism of the Convention, as appropriate, 
to provide financial support for the activities relating to the implementation of Article 6 of 
the Convention, 

Also  recalling  the  Lima  Ministerial  Declaration  on  Education  and  Awareness-
raising,1  which  stresses  that  education,  training,  public  awareness,  public  participation, 
public access to information, knowledge and international cooperation play a fundamental 
role in meeting the ultimate objective of the Convention and in promoting climate-resilient 
sustainable development, 

1. 
Requests the Subsidiary Body for Implementation to launch the intermediate review 
of the implementation of the Doha work programme on Article 6 of the Convention at its 
forty-fourth  session  (May  2016)  on  the  basis  of  the  terms  of  reference  contained  in  the 
annex, with a view to the review being completed by December 2016; 

2. 
Encourages  United Nations organizations, in particular the  members of the United 
Nations Alliance on Climate Change Education, Training and Public Awareness, to submit 
information  on  the  results  of  their  activities,  including  reports  from  relevant  regional  and 
subregional workshops, as appropriate, in order to support the implementation of the Doha 
work programme; 

3. 
Requests  the  Global  Environment  Facility  to  report  on  the  progress  made  in 
providing financial support and implementing activities to contribute to the implementation 
of the Doha work programme;

4. 
Invites multilateral and bilateral institutions and organizations, the private sector and 
donors  to  report  on  financial  resources  provided  to  support  the  activities  relating  to  the 
implementation of Article 6 of the Convention; 

5. 

Requests the secretariat: 

(a) 

To prepare a report on the progress made, as well as emerging gaps, needs, 
and recommendations by Parties, admitted observer organizations and other stakeholders in 
implementing the Doha  work programme as input to the intermediate review, as specified 
in  paragraph  5  of  the  terms  of  reference  contained  in  the  annex,  for  consideration  by  the 
Subsidiary Body for Implementation at its forty-fourth session; 

(b) 

To  continue  facilitating  a  regular  exchange  of  views,  good  practices  and 

lessons learned among national focal points for Article 6 of the Convention; 

(c) 

To  continue  collaborating  with  admitted  observer  organizations  and  other 
stakeholders  and  the  members  of  the  United  Nations  Alliance  on  Climate  Change 
Education,  Training  and  Public  Awareness  so  as  to  catalyse  action  on  Article  6  of  the 
Convention; 

Also  requests  that  the  actions  of  the  secretariat  called  for  in  this  decision  be

Annex 

Terms of reference for the intermediate review of the progress made in 
the implementation of the Doha work programme on Article 6 of the 
Convention 

I.  Mandate 

1. 
At its eighteenth session, the Conference of the Parties (COP) adopted the eight-year 
Doha  work  programme  on  Article  6  of  the  Convention  and  decided  that  it  would  be 
reviewed  in  2020,  with  an  intermediate  review  of  progress  in  2016,  to  evaluate  its 
effectiveness,  identify  any  emerging  gaps  and  needs,  and  inform  any  decisions  on 
improving the effectiveness of the work programme, as appropriate.1 

2. 
By  the  same  decision,  the  COP  requested  the  secretariat  to  prepare  reports  on  the 
progress  made  by  Parties  in  implementing  Article  6  of  the  Convention  based  on 
information  contained  in  national  communications,  reports  on  the  annual  in-session 
Dialogue  on  Article  6  and  other  sources  of  information,  including  a  report  on  good 
practices  of  stakeholder  participation  in  implementing  Article  6  activities.2  These  reports 
will be issued regularly and in particular for the intermediate progress review in 2016 and 
the review in 2020.

Draft decision -/CMP.11 

Methodology for the collection of international transaction 
log fees in the biennium 2016–2017 

The  Conference  of  the  Parties  serving  as  the  meeting  of  the  Parties  to  the  Kyoto 

Protocol, 

Recalling Article 13, paragraph 5, of the Kyoto Protocol, 

Also recalling decisions 11/CMP.3, 10/CMP.5, 9/CMP.6 and 8/CMP.8, 

Recognizing  the  importance  of  sufficient  and  stable  funding  for  the  international 

transaction log, 

Adopts the scale of fees for the international transaction log for the biennium 2016–

1. 
2017 contained in the annex; 

2. 
Decides  that  fees  for  the  international  transaction  log  paid  by  a  Party  for  the 
biennium 2016–2017 shall be calculated by multiplying the scale of fees for that Party, as 
contained in the annex, by the budget for the international transaction log for the biennium 
2016–2017, with the fees for the first year of the biennium being equal to the fees  for the 
second year of the biennium; 

3. 
Requests  the  Executive  Secretary  to  notify  Parties  connected  to  the  international 
transaction  log  in  the  biennium  2016–2017  of  the  annual  fees,  calculated  in  accordance 
with  paragraph  2  above,  as  early  as  possible  and  at  least  four  months  in  advance  of  the 
relevant calendar year, where possible; 

4. 
Decides that, if a Party connects to the international transaction log for the first time 
or  reconnects  to  it  following  disconnection  during  the  biennium  2016–2017,  the  scale  of 
fees for that Party shall be that contained in the annex, or, for Parties not listed in the table 
contained in the annex, shall be made equal to 130 per cent of their Kyoto Protocol adjusted 
scale for the relevant biennium; 

Also decides that fees paid by a Party that connects to the international transaction 
5. 
log for the first time shall be deducted from the resource requirement for activities relating 
to the international transaction log in the next biennium; 

6. 
Further  decides  that  fees  paid  by  a  Party  that  connects  to  the  international 
transaction  log  for  the  first  time  or,  following  disconnection,  reconnects  to  it  during  the 
biennium 2016–2017, shall be proportioned for the period between the date of connection 
or reconnection of its registry and the end of the biennium, except for the period for which 
the fees were already paid; 

Decides that, where a Party disconnects during the biennium 2016–2017, the Party 
7. 
shall cover the fees for the full year in which the disconnection took place, and that, if the 
disconnection takes place in the first year of the biennium and the Party does not reconnect 
in the second year of the biennium, fees for the second year of the biennium shall not apply; 

8. 
Authorizes the  international transaction log administrator  to disconnect  the registry 
of a Party from the international transaction log in the event of the non-payment of its fees 
by  that  Party,  provided  that  such  disconnection  shall  not  be  effected  earlier  than  four 
months  after  the  beginning  of  the  relevant  calendar  year,  at  least  two  reminders  have 
already been given to the Party and consultations have taken place with the Party concerned 
prior to the final reminder;

FCCC/SBI/2015/10/Add.1 

9. 
Also  authorizes  the  Executive  Secretary  to  draw  up  funds  from  unspent  balances 
(carry-over) of the Trust Fund for the International Transaction Log from previous financial 
periods to cover the potential shortfall in fees due to the disconnection of Parties during the 
biennium 2016–2017; 

Requests  the  international  transaction  log  administrator  to  provide,  in  its  annual 

10. 
reports for 2016 and 2017, information on transactions of Kyoto Protocol units; 

Also requests the international transaction log administrator to publish, in its annual 
11. 
reports,  a  table  listing  the  scale  and  the  level  of  fees  and  the  status  of  payments  for  all 
Parties connected to the international transaction log.
