2.  Conclusions 

FCCC/SBSTA/2015/2 

60.  At the request of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties 
to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP),54 the SBSTA continued its work on assessing and addressing 
the implications of the implementation of decisions 2/CMP.7 to 4/CMP.7 and 1/CMP.8 on 
the  previous  decisions  on  methodological  issues  related  to  the  Kyoto  Protocol,  including 
those relating to Articles 5, 7 and 8 of the Kyoto Protocol. 

The SBSTA advanced, but was not able to conclude, its work on the matters referred 
61. 
to in paragraph 60 above. It agreed to continue its consideration of those matters at SBSTA 
43  on  the  basis  of  the  draft  decision  texts  contained  in  annexes  I  and  II  to  document 
FCCC/SBSTA/2015/L.13, with a view to forwarding those draft decisions for consideration 
and adoption at CMP 11 (November–December 2015). 

62. 
The  SBSTA,  affirming  the  interlinkages  between  agenda  sub-items  9(a)  and  (b), 
noted  that  requirements  for  Annex  I  Parties  without  a  quantified  emission  limitation  and 
reduction commitment for the second commitment period  of the Kyoto Protocol would be 
included in a user-friendly document compiled by the secretariat, as agreed at SBSTA 41,55 
after the conclusion of SBSTA agenda sub-item 9(b), in the appropriate sections addressing 
accounting, reporting, review and adjustments.  

63.  As  also  agreed  at  SBSTA  41,56  the  SBSTA  considered  the  updated  training 
programme  for  members  of  expert  review  teams  participating  in  annual  reviews  under 
Article 8 of the Kyoto Protocol. 

64. 
The  SBSTA  agreed  to  forward  a  draft  decision  on  the  training  programme  for 
members  of  expert  review  teams  participating  in  annual  reviews  under  Article  8  of  the 
Kyoto Protocol for consideration and adoption at CMP 11 (for the text of the draft decision, 
see document FCCC/SBSTA/2015/2/Add.2).  

65. 
The  SBSTA  noted  that  the  review  of  the  report  to  facilitate  the  calculation  of  the 
assigned amount for the second commitment period and the review of the GHG inventory 
submissions under the Kyoto Protocol can start at the earliest in 2016. 

66. 
The  SBSTA  also  noted  that  conducting  the  review  of  the  report  to  facilitate  the 
calculation of the assigned amount for the second commitment period and the review of the 
2015  GHG  inventory  submissions  under  the  Kyoto  Protocol  in  early  2016  may  place  an 
excessive  burden  on  Parties,  the  secretariat  and  expert  reviewers  because  of  the 
simultaneous conduct of other review processes in 2016. 

67. 
The SBSTA further noted that the review of the report to facilitate the calculation of 
the  assigned  amount  and  the  review  of  the  first  GHG  inventory  submissions  (2015 
submissions) for the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol may be conducted in 
conjunction  with  the  review  of  the  2016  GHG  inventory  submissions  under  the  Kyoto 
Protocol.

2.  Conclusions 

FCCC/SBSTA/2015/2 

60.  At the request of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties 
to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP),54 the SBSTA continued its work on assessing and addressing 
the implications of the implementation of decisions 2/CMP.7 to 4/CMP.7 and 1/CMP.8 on 
the  previous  decisions  on  methodological  issues  related  to  the  Kyoto  Protocol,  including 
those relating to Articles 5, 7 and 8 of the Kyoto Protocol. 

The SBSTA advanced, but was not able to conclude, its work on the matters referred 
61. 
to in paragraph 60 above. It agreed to continue its consideration of those matters at SBSTA 
43  on  the  basis  of  the  draft  decision  texts  contained  in  annexes  I  and  II  to  document 
FCCC/SBSTA/2015/L.13, with a view to forwarding those draft decisions for consideration 
and adoption at CMP 11 (November–December 2015). 

62. 
The  SBSTA,  affirming  the  interlinkages  between  agenda  sub-items  9(a)  and  (b), 
noted  that  requirements  for  Annex  I  Parties  without  a  quantified  emission  limitation  and 
reduction commitment for the second commitment period  of the Kyoto Protocol would be 
included in a user-friendly document compiled by the secretariat, as agreed at SBSTA 41,55 
after the conclusion of SBSTA agenda sub-item 9(b), in the appropriate sections addressing 
accounting, reporting, review and adjustments.  

63.  As  also  agreed  at  SBSTA  41,56  the  SBSTA  considered  the  updated  training 
programme  for  members  of  expert  review  teams  participating  in  annual  reviews  under 
Article 8 of the Kyoto Protocol. 

64. 
The  SBSTA  agreed  to  forward  a  draft  decision  on  the  training  programme  for 
members  of  expert  review  teams  participating  in  annual  reviews  under  Article  8  of  the 
Kyoto Protocol for consideration and adoption at CMP 11 (for the text of the draft decision, 
see document FCCC/SBSTA/2015/2/Add.2).  

65. 
The  SBSTA  noted  that  the  review  of  the  report  to  facilitate  the  calculation  of  the 
assigned amount for the second commitment period and the review of the GHG inventory 
submissions under the Kyoto Protocol can start at the earliest in 2016. 

66. 
The  SBSTA  also  noted  that  conducting  the  review  of  the  report  to  facilitate  the 
calculation of the assigned amount for the second commitment period and the review of the 
2015  GHG  inventory  submissions  under  the  Kyoto  Protocol  in  early  2016  may  place  an 
excessive  burden  on  Parties,  the  secretariat  and  expert  reviewers  because  of  the 
simultaneous conduct of other review processes in 2016. 

67. 
The SBSTA further noted that the review of the report to facilitate the calculation of 
the  assigned  amount  and  the  review  of  the  first  GHG  inventory  submissions  (2015 
submissions) for the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol may be conducted in 
conjunction  with  the  review  of  the  2016  GHG  inventory  submissions  under  the  Kyoto 
Protocol.

2.  Conclusions 

FCCC/SBSTA/2015/2 

60.  At the request of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties 
to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP),54 the SBSTA continued its work on assessing and addressing 
the implications of the implementation of decisions 2/CMP.7 to 4/CMP.7 and 1/CMP.8 on 
the  previous  decisions  on  methodological  issues  related  to  the  Kyoto  Protocol,  including 
those relating to Articles 5, 7 and 8 of the Kyoto Protocol. 

The SBSTA advanced, but was not able to conclude, its work on the matters referred 
61. 
to in paragraph 60 above. It agreed to continue its consideration of those matters at SBSTA 
43  on  the  basis  of  the  draft  decision  texts  contained  in  annexes  I  and  II  to  document 
FCCC/SBSTA/2015/L.13, with a view to forwarding those draft decisions for consideration 
and adoption at CMP 11 (November–December 2015). 

62. 
The  SBSTA,  affirming  the  interlinkages  between  agenda  sub-items  9(a)  and  (b), 
noted  that  requirements  for  Annex  I  Parties  without  a  quantified  emission  limitation  and 
reduction commitment for the second commitment period  of the Kyoto Protocol would be 
included in a user-friendly document compiled by the secretariat, as agreed at SBSTA 41,55 
after the conclusion of SBSTA agenda sub-item 9(b), in the appropriate sections addressing 
accounting, reporting, review and adjustments.  

63.  As  also  agreed  at  SBSTA  41,56  the  SBSTA  considered  the  updated  training 
programme  for  members  of  expert  review  teams  participating  in  annual  reviews  under 
Article 8 of the Kyoto Protocol. 

64. 
The  SBSTA  agreed  to  forward  a  draft  decision  on  the  training  programme  for 
members  of  expert  review  teams  participating  in  annual  reviews  under  Article  8  of  the 
Kyoto Protocol for consideration and adoption at CMP 11 (for the text of the draft decision, 
see document FCCC/SBSTA/2015/2/Add.2).  

65. 
The  SBSTA  noted  that  the  review  of  the  report  to  facilitate  the  calculation  of  the 
assigned amount for the second commitment period and the review of the GHG inventory 
submissions under the Kyoto Protocol can start at the earliest in 2016. 

66. 
The  SBSTA  also  noted  that  conducting  the  review  of  the  report  to  facilitate  the 
calculation of the assigned amount for the second commitment period and the review of the 
2015  GHG  inventory  submissions  under  the  Kyoto  Protocol  in  early  2016  may  place  an 
excessive  burden  on  Parties,  the  secretariat  and  expert  reviewers  because  of  the 
simultaneous conduct of other review processes in 2016. 

67. 
The SBSTA further noted that the review of the report to facilitate the calculation of 
the  assigned  amount  and  the  review  of  the  first  GHG  inventory  submissions  (2015 
submissions) for the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol may be conducted in 
conjunction  with  the  review  of  the  2016  GHG  inventory  submissions  under  the  Kyoto 
Protocol.

2.  Conclusions 

FCCC/SBSTA/2015/2 

60.  At the request of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties 
to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP),54 the SBSTA continued its work on assessing and addressing 
the implications of the implementation of decisions 2/CMP.7 to 4/CMP.7 and 1/CMP.8 on 
the  previous  decisions  on  methodological  issues  related  to  the  Kyoto  Protocol,  including 
those relating to Articles 5, 7 and 8 of the Kyoto Protocol. 

The SBSTA advanced, but was not able to conclude, its work on the matters referred 
61. 
to in paragraph 60 above. It agreed to continue its consideration of those matters at SBSTA 
43  on  the  basis  of  the  draft  decision  texts  contained  in  annexes  I  and  II  to  document 
FCCC/SBSTA/2015/L.13, with a view to forwarding those draft decisions for consideration 
and adoption at CMP 11 (November–December 2015). 

62. 
The  SBSTA,  affirming  the  interlinkages  between  agenda  sub-items  9(a)  and  (b), 
noted  that  requirements  for  Annex  I  Parties  without  a  quantified  emission  limitation  and 
reduction commitment for the second commitment period  of the Kyoto Protocol would be 
included in a user-friendly document compiled by the secretariat, as agreed at SBSTA 41,55 
after the conclusion of SBSTA agenda sub-item 9(b), in the appropriate sections addressing 
accounting, reporting, review and adjustments.  

63.  As  also  agreed  at  SBSTA  41,56  the  SBSTA  considered  the  updated  training 
programme  for  members  of  expert  review  teams  participating  in  annual  reviews  under 
Article 8 of the Kyoto Protocol. 

64. 
The  SBSTA  agreed  to  forward  a  draft  decision  on  the  training  programme  for 
members  of  expert  review  teams  participating  in  annual  reviews  under  Article  8  of  the 
Kyoto Protocol for consideration and adoption at CMP 11 (for the text of the draft decision, 
see document FCCC/SBSTA/2015/2/Add.2).  

65. 
The  SBSTA  noted  that  the  review  of  the  report  to  facilitate  the  calculation  of  the 
assigned amount for the second commitment period and the review of the GHG inventory 
submissions under the Kyoto Protocol can start at the earliest in 2016. 

66. 
The  SBSTA  also  noted  that  conducting  the  review  of  the  report  to  facilitate  the 
calculation of the assigned amount for the second commitment period and the review of the 
2015  GHG  inventory  submissions  under  the  Kyoto  Protocol  in  early  2016  may  place  an 
excessive  burden  on  Parties,  the  secretariat  and  expert  reviewers  because  of  the 
simultaneous conduct of other review processes in 2016. 

67. 
The SBSTA further noted that the review of the report to facilitate the calculation of 
the  assigned  amount  and  the  review  of  the  first  GHG  inventory  submissions  (2015 
submissions) for the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol may be conducted in 
conjunction  with  the  review  of  the  2016  GHG  inventory  submissions  under  the  Kyoto 
Protocol.

2.  Conclusions 

FCCC/SBSTA/2015/2 

60.  At the request of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties 
to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP),54 the SBSTA continued its work on assessing and addressing 
the implications of the implementation of decisions 2/CMP.7 to 4/CMP.7 and 1/CMP.8 on 
the  previous  decisions  on  methodological  issues  related  to  the  Kyoto  Protocol,  including 
those relating to Articles 5, 7 and 8 of the Kyoto Protocol. 

The SBSTA advanced, but was not able to conclude, its work on the matters referred 
61. 
to in paragraph 60 above. It agreed to continue its consideration of those matters at SBSTA 
43  on  the  basis  of  the  draft  decision  texts  contained  in  annexes  I  and  II  to  document 
FCCC/SBSTA/2015/L.13, with a view to forwarding those draft decisions for consideration 
and adoption at CMP 11 (November–December 2015). 

62. 
The  SBSTA,  affirming  the  interlinkages  between  agenda  sub-items  9(a)  and  (b), 
noted  that  requirements  for  Annex  I  Parties  without  a  quantified  emission  limitation  and 
reduction commitment for the second commitment period  of the Kyoto Protocol would be 
included in a user-friendly document compiled by the secretariat, as agreed at SBSTA 41,55 
after the conclusion of SBSTA agenda sub-item 9(b), in the appropriate sections addressing 
accounting, reporting, review and adjustments.  

63.  As  also  agreed  at  SBSTA  41,56  the  SBSTA  considered  the  updated  training 
programme  for  members  of  expert  review  teams  participating  in  annual  reviews  under 
Article 8 of the Kyoto Protocol. 

64. 
The  SBSTA  agreed  to  forward  a  draft  decision  on  the  training  programme  for 
members  of  expert  review  teams  participating  in  annual  reviews  under  Article  8  of  the 
Kyoto Protocol for consideration and adoption at CMP 11 (for the text of the draft decision, 
see document FCCC/SBSTA/2015/2/Add.2).  

65. 
The  SBSTA  noted  that  the  review  of  the  report  to  facilitate  the  calculation  of  the 
assigned amount for the second commitment period and the review of the GHG inventory 
submissions under the Kyoto Protocol can start at the earliest in 2016. 

66. 
The  SBSTA  also  noted  that  conducting  the  review  of  the  report  to  facilitate  the 
calculation of the assigned amount for the second commitment period and the review of the 
2015  GHG  inventory  submissions  under  the  Kyoto  Protocol  in  early  2016  may  place  an 
excessive  burden  on  Parties,  the  secretariat  and  expert  reviewers  because  of  the 
simultaneous conduct of other review processes in 2016. 

67. 
The SBSTA further noted that the review of the report to facilitate the calculation of 
the  assigned  amount  and  the  review  of  the  first  GHG  inventory  submissions  (2015 
submissions) for the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol may be conducted in 
conjunction  with  the  review  of  the  2016  GHG  inventory  submissions  under  the  Kyoto 
Protocol.

2.  Conclusions 

FCCC/SBSTA/2015/2 

60.  At the request of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties 
to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP),54 the SBSTA continued its work on assessing and addressing 
the implications of the implementation of decisions 2/CMP.7 to 4/CMP.7 and 1/CMP.8 on 
the  previous  decisions  on  methodological  issues  related  to  the  Kyoto  Protocol,  including 
those relating to Articles 5, 7 and 8 of the Kyoto Protocol. 

The SBSTA advanced, but was not able to conclude, its work on the matters referred 
61. 
to in paragraph 60 above. It agreed to continue its consideration of those matters at SBSTA 
43  on  the  basis  of  the  draft  decision  texts  contained  in  annexes  I  and  II  to  document 
FCCC/SBSTA/2015/L.13, with a view to forwarding those draft decisions for consideration 
and adoption at CMP 11 (November–December 2015). 

62. 
The  SBSTA,  affirming  the  interlinkages  between  agenda  sub-items  9(a)  and  (b), 
noted  that  requirements  for  Annex  I  Parties  without  a  quantified  emission  limitation  and 
reduction commitment for the second commitment period  of the Kyoto Protocol would be 
included in a user-friendly document compiled by the secretariat, as agreed at SBSTA 41,55 
after the conclusion of SBSTA agenda sub-item 9(b), in the appropriate sections addressing 
accounting, reporting, review and adjustments.  

63.  As  also  agreed  at  SBSTA  41,56  the  SBSTA  considered  the  updated  training 
programme  for  members  of  expert  review  teams  participating  in  annual  reviews  under 
Article 8 of the Kyoto Protocol. 

64. 
The  SBSTA  agreed  to  forward  a  draft  decision  on  the  training  programme  for 
members  of  expert  review  teams  participating  in  annual  reviews  under  Article  8  of  the 
Kyoto Protocol for consideration and adoption at CMP 11 (for the text of the draft decision, 
see document FCCC/SBSTA/2015/2/Add.2).  

65. 
The  SBSTA  noted  that  the  review  of  the  report  to  facilitate  the  calculation  of  the 
assigned amount for the second commitment period and the review of the GHG inventory 
submissions under the Kyoto Protocol can start at the earliest in 2016. 

66. 
The  SBSTA  also  noted  that  conducting  the  review  of  the  report  to  facilitate  the 
calculation of the assigned amount for the second commitment period and the review of the 
2015  GHG  inventory  submissions  under  the  Kyoto  Protocol  in  early  2016  may  place  an 
excessive  burden  on  Parties,  the  secretariat  and  expert  reviewers  because  of  the 
simultaneous conduct of other review processes in 2016. 

67. 
The SBSTA further noted that the review of the report to facilitate the calculation of 
the  assigned  amount  and  the  review  of  the  first  GHG  inventory  submissions  (2015 
submissions) for the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol may be conducted in 
conjunction  with  the  review  of  the  2016  GHG  inventory  submissions  under  the  Kyoto 
Protocol.

2.  Conclusions 

FCCC/SBSTA/2015/2 

60.  At the request of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties 
to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP),54 the SBSTA continued its work on assessing and addressing 
the implications of the implementation of decisions 2/CMP.7 to 4/CMP.7 and 1/CMP.8 on 
the  previous  decisions  on  methodological  issues  related  to  the  Kyoto  Protocol,  including 
those relating to Articles 5, 7 and 8 of the Kyoto Protocol. 

The SBSTA advanced, but was not able to conclude, its work on the matters referred 
61. 
to in paragraph 60 above. It agreed to continue its consideration of those matters at SBSTA 
43  on  the  basis  of  the  draft  decision  texts  contained  in  annexes  I  and  II  to  document 
FCCC/SBSTA/2015/L.13, with a view to forwarding those draft decisions for consideration 
and adoption at CMP 11 (November–December 2015). 

62. 
The  SBSTA,  affirming  the  interlinkages  between  agenda  sub-items  9(a)  and  (b), 
noted  that  requirements  for  Annex  I  Parties  without  a  quantified  emission  limitation  and 
reduction commitment for the second commitment period  of the Kyoto Protocol would be 
included in a user-friendly document compiled by the secretariat, as agreed at SBSTA 41,55 
after the conclusion of SBSTA agenda sub-item 9(b), in the appropriate sections addressing 
accounting, reporting, review and adjustments.  

63.  As  also  agreed  at  SBSTA  41,56  the  SBSTA  considered  the  updated  training 
programme  for  members  of  expert  review  teams  participating  in  annual  reviews  under 
Article 8 of the Kyoto Protocol. 

64. 
The  SBSTA  agreed  to  forward  a  draft  decision  on  the  training  programme  for 
members  of  expert  review  teams  participating  in  annual  reviews  under  Article  8  of  the 
Kyoto Protocol for consideration and adoption at CMP 11 (for the text of the draft decision, 
see document FCCC/SBSTA/2015/2/Add.2).  

65. 
The  SBSTA  noted  that  the  review  of  the  report  to  facilitate  the  calculation  of  the 
assigned amount for the second commitment period and the review of the GHG inventory 
submissions under the Kyoto Protocol can start at the earliest in 2016. 

66. 
The  SBSTA  also  noted  that  conducting  the  review  of  the  report  to  facilitate  the 
calculation of the assigned amount for the second commitment period and the review of the 
2015  GHG  inventory  submissions  under  the  Kyoto  Protocol  in  early  2016  may  place  an 
excessive  burden  on  Parties,  the  secretariat  and  expert  reviewers  because  of  the 
simultaneous conduct of other review processes in 2016. 

67. 
The SBSTA further noted that the review of the report to facilitate the calculation of 
the  assigned  amount  and  the  review  of  the  first  GHG  inventory  submissions  (2015 
submissions) for the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol may be conducted in 
conjunction  with  the  review  of  the  2016  GHG  inventory  submissions  under  the  Kyoto 
Protocol.

2.  Conclusions 

FCCC/SBSTA/2015/2 

60.  At the request of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties 
to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP),54 the SBSTA continued its work on assessing and addressing 
the implications of the implementation of decisions 2/CMP.7 to 4/CMP.7 and 1/CMP.8 on 
the  previous  decisions  on  methodological  issues  related  to  the  Kyoto  Protocol,  including 
those relating to Articles 5, 7 and 8 of the Kyoto Protocol. 

The SBSTA advanced, but was not able to conclude, its work on the matters referred 
61. 
to in paragraph 60 above. It agreed to continue its consideration of those matters at SBSTA 
43  on  the  basis  of  the  draft  decision  texts  contained  in  annexes  I  and  II  to  document 
FCCC/SBSTA/2015/L.13, with a view to forwarding those draft decisions for consideration 
and adoption at CMP 11 (November–December 2015). 

62. 
The  SBSTA,  affirming  the  interlinkages  between  agenda  sub-items  9(a)  and  (b), 
noted  that  requirements  for  Annex  I  Parties  without  a  quantified  emission  limitation  and 
reduction commitment for the second commitment period  of the Kyoto Protocol would be 
included in a user-friendly document compiled by the secretariat, as agreed at SBSTA 41,55 
after the conclusion of SBSTA agenda sub-item 9(b), in the appropriate sections addressing 
accounting, reporting, review and adjustments.  

63.  As  also  agreed  at  SBSTA  41,56  the  SBSTA  considered  the  updated  training 
programme  for  members  of  expert  review  teams  participating  in  annual  reviews  under 
Article 8 of the Kyoto Protocol. 

64. 
The  SBSTA  agreed  to  forward  a  draft  decision  on  the  training  programme  for 
members  of  expert  review  teams  participating  in  annual  reviews  under  Article  8  of  the 
Kyoto Protocol for consideration and adoption at CMP 11 (for the text of the draft decision, 
see document FCCC/SBSTA/2015/2/Add.2).  

65. 
The  SBSTA  noted  that  the  review  of  the  report  to  facilitate  the  calculation  of  the 
assigned amount for the second commitment period and the review of the GHG inventory 
submissions under the Kyoto Protocol can start at the earliest in 2016. 

66. 
The  SBSTA  also  noted  that  conducting  the  review  of  the  report  to  facilitate  the 
calculation of the assigned amount for the second commitment period and the review of the 
2015  GHG  inventory  submissions  under  the  Kyoto  Protocol  in  early  2016  may  place  an 
excessive  burden  on  Parties,  the  secretariat  and  expert  reviewers  because  of  the 
simultaneous conduct of other review processes in 2016. 

67. 
The SBSTA further noted that the review of the report to facilitate the calculation of 
the  assigned  amount  and  the  review  of  the  first  GHG  inventory  submissions  (2015 
submissions) for the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol may be conducted in 
conjunction  with  the  review  of  the  2016  GHG  inventory  submissions  under  the  Kyoto 
Protocol.

2.  Conclusions 

FCCC/SBSTA/2015/2 

60.  At the request of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties 
to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP),54 the SBSTA continued its work on assessing and addressing 
the implications of the implementation of decisions 2/CMP.7 to 4/CMP.7 and 1/CMP.8 on 
the  previous  decisions  on  methodological  issues  related  to  the  Kyoto  Protocol,  including 
those relating to Articles 5, 7 and 8 of the Kyoto Protocol. 

The SBSTA advanced, but was not able to conclude, its work on the matters referred 
61. 
to in paragraph 60 above. It agreed to continue its consideration of those matters at SBSTA 
43  on  the  basis  of  the  draft  decision  texts  contained  in  annexes  I  and  II  to  document 
FCCC/SBSTA/2015/L.13, with a view to forwarding those draft decisions for consideration 
and adoption at CMP 11 (November–December 2015). 

62. 
The  SBSTA,  affirming  the  interlinkages  between  agenda  sub-items  9(a)  and  (b), 
noted  that  requirements  for  Annex  I  Parties  without  a  quantified  emission  limitation  and 
reduction commitment for the second commitment period  of the Kyoto Protocol would be 
included in a user-friendly document compiled by the secretariat, as agreed at SBSTA 41,55 
after the conclusion of SBSTA agenda sub-item 9(b), in the appropriate sections addressing 
accounting, reporting, review and adjustments.  

63.  As  also  agreed  at  SBSTA  41,56  the  SBSTA  considered  the  updated  training 
programme  for  members  of  expert  review  teams  participating  in  annual  reviews  under 
Article 8 of the Kyoto Protocol. 

64. 
The  SBSTA  agreed  to  forward  a  draft  decision  on  the  training  programme  for 
members  of  expert  review  teams  participating  in  annual  reviews  under  Article  8  of  the 
Kyoto Protocol for consideration and adoption at CMP 11 (for the text of the draft decision, 
see document FCCC/SBSTA/2015/2/Add.2).  

65. 
The  SBSTA  noted  that  the  review  of  the  report  to  facilitate  the  calculation  of  the 
assigned amount for the second commitment period and the review of the GHG inventory 
submissions under the Kyoto Protocol can start at the earliest in 2016. 

66. 
The  SBSTA  also  noted  that  conducting  the  review  of  the  report  to  facilitate  the 
calculation of the assigned amount for the second commitment period and the review of the 
2015  GHG  inventory  submissions  under  the  Kyoto  Protocol  in  early  2016  may  place  an 
excessive  burden  on  Parties,  the  secretariat  and  expert  reviewers  because  of  the 
simultaneous conduct of other review processes in 2016. 

67. 
The SBSTA further noted that the review of the report to facilitate the calculation of 
the  assigned  amount  and  the  review  of  the  first  GHG  inventory  submissions  (2015 
submissions) for the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol may be conducted in 
conjunction  with  the  review  of  the  2016  GHG  inventory  submissions  under  the  Kyoto 
Protocol.

2.  Conclusions 

FCCC/SBSTA/2015/2 

60.  At the request of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties 
to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP),54 the SBSTA continued its work on assessing and addressing 
the implications of the implementation of decisions 2/CMP.7 to 4/CMP.7 and 1/CMP.8 on 
the  previous  decisions  on  methodological  issues  related  to  the  Kyoto  Protocol,  including 
those relating to Articles 5, 7 and 8 of the Kyoto Protocol. 

The SBSTA advanced, but was not able to conclude, its work on the matters referred 
61. 
to in paragraph 60 above. It agreed to continue its consideration of those matters at SBSTA 
43  on  the  basis  of  the  draft  decision  texts  contained  in  annexes  I  and  II  to  document 
FCCC/SBSTA/2015/L.13, with a view to forwarding those draft decisions for consideration 
and adoption at CMP 11 (November–December 2015). 

62. 
The  SBSTA,  affirming  the  interlinkages  between  agenda  sub-items  9(a)  and  (b), 
noted  that  requirements  for  Annex  I  Parties  without  a  quantified  emission  limitation  and 
reduction commitment for the second commitment period  of the Kyoto Protocol would be 
included in a user-friendly document compiled by the secretariat, as agreed at SBSTA 41,55 
after the conclusion of SBSTA agenda sub-item 9(b), in the appropriate sections addressing 
accounting, reporting, review and adjustments.  

63.  As  also  agreed  at  SBSTA  41,56  the  SBSTA  considered  the  updated  training 
programme  for  members  of  expert  review  teams  participating  in  annual  reviews  under 
Article 8 of the Kyoto Protocol. 

64. 
The  SBSTA  agreed  to  forward  a  draft  decision  on  the  training  programme  for 
members  of  expert  review  teams  participating  in  annual  reviews  under  Article  8  of  the 
Kyoto Protocol for consideration and adoption at CMP 11 (for the text of the draft decision, 
see document FCCC/SBSTA/2015/2/Add.2).  

65. 
The  SBSTA  noted  that  the  review  of  the  report  to  facilitate  the  calculation  of  the 
assigned amount for the second commitment period and the review of the GHG inventory 
submissions under the Kyoto Protocol can start at the earliest in 2016. 

66. 
The  SBSTA  also  noted  that  conducting  the  review  of  the  report  to  facilitate  the 
calculation of the assigned amount for the second commitment period and the review of the 
2015  GHG  inventory  submissions  under  the  Kyoto  Protocol  in  early  2016  may  place  an 
excessive  burden  on  Parties,  the  secretariat  and  expert  reviewers  because  of  the 
simultaneous conduct of other review processes in 2016. 

67. 
The SBSTA further noted that the review of the report to facilitate the calculation of 
the  assigned  amount  and  the  review  of  the  first  GHG  inventory  submissions  (2015 
submissions) for the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol may be conducted in 
conjunction  with  the  review  of  the  2016  GHG  inventory  submissions  under  the  Kyoto 
Protocol.

2.  Conclusions 

FCCC/SBSTA/2015/2 

60.  At the request of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties 
to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP),54 the SBSTA continued its work on assessing and addressing 
the implications of the implementation of decisions 2/CMP.7 to 4/CMP.7 and 1/CMP.8 on 
the  previous  decisions  on  methodological  issues  related  to  the  Kyoto  Protocol,  including 
those relating to Articles 5, 7 and 8 of the Kyoto Protocol. 

The SBSTA advanced, but was not able to conclude, its work on the matters referred 
61. 
to in paragraph 60 above. It agreed to continue its consideration of those matters at SBSTA 
43  on  the  basis  of  the  draft  decision  texts  contained  in  annexes  I  and  II  to  document 
FCCC/SBSTA/2015/L.13, with a view to forwarding those draft decisions for consideration 
and adoption at CMP 11 (November–December 2015). 

62. 
The  SBSTA,  affirming  the  interlinkages  between  agenda  sub-items  9(a)  and  (b), 
noted  that  requirements  for  Annex  I  Parties  without  a  quantified  emission  limitation  and 
reduction commitment for the second commitment period  of the Kyoto Protocol would be 
included in a user-friendly document compiled by the secretariat, as agreed at SBSTA 41,55 
after the conclusion of SBSTA agenda sub-item 9(b), in the appropriate sections addressing 
accounting, reporting, review and adjustments.  

63.  As  also  agreed  at  SBSTA  41,56  the  SBSTA  considered  the  updated  training 
programme  for  members  of  expert  review  teams  participating  in  annual  reviews  under 
Article 8 of the Kyoto Protocol. 

64. 
The  SBSTA  agreed  to  forward  a  draft  decision  on  the  training  programme  for 
members  of  expert  review  teams  participating  in  annual  reviews  under  Article  8  of  the 
Kyoto Protocol for consideration and adoption at CMP 11 (for the text of the draft decision, 
see document FCCC/SBSTA/2015/2/Add.2).  

65. 
The  SBSTA  noted  that  the  review  of  the  report  to  facilitate  the  calculation  of  the 
assigned amount for the second commitment period and the review of the GHG inventory 
submissions under the Kyoto Protocol can start at the earliest in 2016. 

66. 
The  SBSTA  also  noted  that  conducting  the  review  of  the  report  to  facilitate  the 
calculation of the assigned amount for the second commitment period and the review of the 
2015  GHG  inventory  submissions  under  the  Kyoto  Protocol  in  early  2016  may  place  an 
excessive  burden  on  Parties,  the  secretariat  and  expert  reviewers  because  of  the 
simultaneous conduct of other review processes in 2016. 

67. 
The SBSTA further noted that the review of the report to facilitate the calculation of 
the  assigned  amount  and  the  review  of  the  first  GHG  inventory  submissions  (2015 
submissions) for the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol may be conducted in 
conjunction  with  the  review  of  the  2016  GHG  inventory  submissions  under  the  Kyoto 
Protocol.

2.  Conclusions 

FCCC/SBSTA/2015/2 

60.  At the request of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties 
to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP),54 the SBSTA continued its work on assessing and addressing 
the implications of the implementation of decisions 2/CMP.7 to 4/CMP.7 and 1/CMP.8 on 
the  previous  decisions  on  methodological  issues  related  to  the  Kyoto  Protocol,  including 
those relating to Articles 5, 7 and 8 of the Kyoto Protocol. 

The SBSTA advanced, but was not able to conclude, its work on the matters referred 
61. 
to in paragraph 60 above. It agreed to continue its consideration of those matters at SBSTA 
43  on  the  basis  of  the  draft  decision  texts  contained  in  annexes  I  and  II  to  document 
FCCC/SBSTA/2015/L.13, with a view to forwarding those draft decisions for consideration 
and adoption at CMP 11 (November–December 2015). 

62. 
The  SBSTA,  affirming  the  interlinkages  between  agenda  sub-items  9(a)  and  (b), 
noted  that  requirements  for  Annex  I  Parties  without  a  quantified  emission  limitation  and 
reduction commitment for the second commitment period  of the Kyoto Protocol would be 
included in a user-friendly document compiled by the secretariat, as agreed at SBSTA 41,55 
after the conclusion of SBSTA agenda sub-item 9(b), in the appropriate sections addressing 
accounting, reporting, review and adjustments.  

63.  As  also  agreed  at  SBSTA  41,56  the  SBSTA  considered  the  updated  training 
programme  for  members  of  expert  review  teams  participating  in  annual  reviews  under 
Article 8 of the Kyoto Protocol. 

64. 
The  SBSTA  agreed  to  forward  a  draft  decision  on  the  training  programme  for 
members  of  expert  review  teams  participating  in  annual  reviews  under  Article  8  of  the 
Kyoto Protocol for consideration and adoption at CMP 11 (for the text of the draft decision, 
see document FCCC/SBSTA/2015/2/Add.2).  

65. 
The  SBSTA  noted  that  the  review  of  the  report  to  facilitate  the  calculation  of  the 
assigned amount for the second commitment period and the review of the GHG inventory 
submissions under the Kyoto Protocol can start at the earliest in 2016. 

66. 
The  SBSTA  also  noted  that  conducting  the  review  of  the  report  to  facilitate  the 
calculation of the assigned amount for the second commitment period and the review of the 
2015  GHG  inventory  submissions  under  the  Kyoto  Protocol  in  early  2016  may  place  an 
excessive  burden  on  Parties,  the  secretariat  and  expert  reviewers  because  of  the 
simultaneous conduct of other review processes in 2016. 

67. 
The SBSTA further noted that the review of the report to facilitate the calculation of 
the  assigned  amount  and  the  review  of  the  first  GHG  inventory  submissions  (2015 
submissions) for the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol may be conducted in 
conjunction  with  the  review  of  the  2016  GHG  inventory  submissions  under  the  Kyoto 
Protocol.

2.  Conclusions 

FCCC/SBSTA/2015/2 

60.  At the request of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties 
to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP),54 the SBSTA continued its work on assessing and addressing 
the implications of the implementation of decisions 2/CMP.7 to 4/CMP.7 and 1/CMP.8 on 
the  previous  decisions  on  methodological  issues  related  to  the  Kyoto  Protocol,  including 
those relating to Articles 5, 7 and 8 of the Kyoto Protocol. 

The SBSTA advanced, but was not able to conclude, its work on the matters referred 
61. 
to in paragraph 60 above. It agreed to continue its consideration of those matters at SBSTA 
43  on  the  basis  of  the  draft  decision  texts  contained  in  annexes  I  and  II  to  document 
FCCC/SBSTA/2015/L.13, with a view to forwarding those draft decisions for consideration 
and adoption at CMP 11 (November–December 2015). 

62. 
The  SBSTA,  affirming  the  interlinkages  between  agenda  sub-items  9(a)  and  (b), 
noted  that  requirements  for  Annex  I  Parties  without  a  quantified  emission  limitation  and 
reduction commitment for the second commitment period  of the Kyoto Protocol would be 
included in a user-friendly document compiled by the secretariat, as agreed at SBSTA 41,55 
after the conclusion of SBSTA agenda sub-item 9(b), in the appropriate sections addressing 
accounting, reporting, review and adjustments.  

63.  As  also  agreed  at  SBSTA  41,56  the  SBSTA  considered  the  updated  training 
programme  for  members  of  expert  review  teams  participating  in  annual  reviews  under 
Article 8 of the Kyoto Protocol. 

64. 
The  SBSTA  agreed  to  forward  a  draft  decision  on  the  training  programme  for 
members  of  expert  review  teams  participating  in  annual  reviews  under  Article  8  of  the 
Kyoto Protocol for consideration and adoption at CMP 11 (for the text of the draft decision, 
see document FCCC/SBSTA/2015/2/Add.2).  

65. 
The  SBSTA  noted  that  the  review  of  the  report  to  facilitate  the  calculation  of  the 
assigned amount for the second commitment period and the review of the GHG inventory 
submissions under the Kyoto Protocol can start at the earliest in 2016. 

66. 
The  SBSTA  also  noted  that  conducting  the  review  of  the  report  to  facilitate  the 
calculation of the assigned amount for the second commitment period and the review of the 
2015  GHG  inventory  submissions  under  the  Kyoto  Protocol  in  early  2016  may  place  an 
excessive  burden  on  Parties,  the  secretariat  and  expert  reviewers  because  of  the 
simultaneous conduct of other review processes in 2016. 

67. 
The SBSTA further noted that the review of the report to facilitate the calculation of 
the  assigned  amount  and  the  review  of  the  first  GHG  inventory  submissions  (2015 
submissions) for the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol may be conducted in 
conjunction  with  the  review  of  the  2016  GHG  inventory  submissions  under  the  Kyoto 
Protocol.

2.  Conclusions 

FCCC/SBSTA/2015/2 

60.  At the request of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties 
to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP),54 the SBSTA continued its work on assessing and addressing 
the implications of the implementation of decisions 2/CMP.7 to 4/CMP.7 and 1/CMP.8 on 
the  previous  decisions  on  methodological  issues  related  to  the  Kyoto  Protocol,  including 
those relating to Articles 5, 7 and 8 of the Kyoto Protocol. 

The SBSTA advanced, but was not able to conclude, its work on the matters referred 
61. 
to in paragraph 60 above. It agreed to continue its consideration of those matters at SBSTA 
43  on  the  basis  of  the  draft  decision  texts  contained  in  annexes  I  and  II  to  document 
FCCC/SBSTA/2015/L.13, with a view to forwarding those draft decisions for consideration 
and adoption at CMP 11 (November–December 2015). 

62. 
The  SBSTA,  affirming  the  interlinkages  between  agenda  sub-items  9(a)  and  (b), 
noted  that  requirements  for  Annex  I  Parties  without  a  quantified  emission  limitation  and 
reduction commitment for the second commitment period  of the Kyoto Protocol would be 
included in a user-friendly document compiled by the secretariat, as agreed at SBSTA 41,55 
after the conclusion of SBSTA agenda sub-item 9(b), in the appropriate sections addressing 
accounting, reporting, review and adjustments.  

63.  As  also  agreed  at  SBSTA  41,56  the  SBSTA  considered  the  updated  training 
programme  for  members  of  expert  review  teams  participating  in  annual  reviews  under 
Article 8 of the Kyoto Protocol. 

64. 
The  SBSTA  agreed  to  forward  a  draft  decision  on  the  training  programme  for 
members  of  expert  review  teams  participating  in  annual  reviews  under  Article  8  of  the 
Kyoto Protocol for consideration and adoption at CMP 11 (for the text of the draft decision, 
see document FCCC/SBSTA/2015/2/Add.2).  

65. 
The  SBSTA  noted  that  the  review  of  the  report  to  facilitate  the  calculation  of  the 
assigned amount for the second commitment period and the review of the GHG inventory 
submissions under the Kyoto Protocol can start at the earliest in 2016. 

66. 
The  SBSTA  also  noted  that  conducting  the  review  of  the  report  to  facilitate  the 
calculation of the assigned amount for the second commitment period and the review of the 
2015  GHG  inventory  submissions  under  the  Kyoto  Protocol  in  early  2016  may  place  an 
excessive  burden  on  Parties,  the  secretariat  and  expert  reviewers  because  of  the 
simultaneous conduct of other review processes in 2016. 

67. 
The SBSTA further noted that the review of the report to facilitate the calculation of 
the  assigned  amount  and  the  review  of  the  first  GHG  inventory  submissions  (2015 
submissions) for the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol may be conducted in 
conjunction  with  the  review  of  the  2016  GHG  inventory  submissions  under  the  Kyoto 
Protocol.
