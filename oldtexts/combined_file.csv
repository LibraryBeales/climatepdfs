This event took place on 5 December. \n\nIII.  Implementation of all the elements of decision 1/CP.17 \n\n(Agenda item 3) \n\n1.  Proceedings \n\nThe ADP considered this item at its 13th meeting, as well as at its 14th meeting, on \n11. \n13  December.  It  had  before  it  documents  FCCC/ADP/2014/3,  FCCC/ADP/2014/L.4, \nFCCC/ADP/2014/L.5,  FCCC/ADP/2014/CRP.4  and  FCCC/2014/TP/13  and  Add.1–4,  as \nwell as the informal notes prepared for the seventh part of the session.7 \n\n12.  At the 13th meeting, the Co-Chairs recalled the establishment of the contact group on \nitem 3, referred to in paragraph  8 above, and its  mandate  to  work in accordance  with the \nagreed  agenda  and  established  UNFCCC  practice.  They  also  recalled  the  core  principles \nguiding the work of the ADP, namely that the process will continue to be Party-driven and \nbuild  on  inputs  from  Parties,  and  that  any  outputs  of  the  process  will  reflect  inputs  from \nParties.  \n\n13.  At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the attention of delegates to the informal \ndocuments prepared by the Co-Chairs and aimed at supporting delegates by providing focus \n\n3  FCCC/ADP/2013/2, paragraphs 8 and 9. \n4  ADP.2014.10.InformalNote. \n5  Decision 1/CP.19. \n6  FCCC/ADP/2014/1, paragraph 19. \n7  The informal notes are listed in annex II. \n\n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n                                                           \n \n \n \n \n \n\x0cFCCC/ADP/2014/4 \n\nto the negotiations and capturing the progress made by the ADP as well as the submissions \nreceived, namely: \n\n(a) \n\nA non-paper on elements for a draft negotiating text updating the earlier non-\n\npaper;8 \n\n(b)  A  draft  decision  text  on  advancing  the  Durban  Platform  for  Enhanced \n\nAction.9 \n\nThe  Co-Chairs  underlined  the  need  to  continue  the  consideration  and  further \n14. \nelaboration of the elements for a draft negotiating text with a view to making a negotiating \ntext available before May 2015, in line with the  mandates contained in decisions 2/CP.18 \nand  1/CP.19.  The  Co-Chairs  also  stressed  the  need  for  the  ADP  to  consider  how  to  take \nforward its work on the elements, and how to forward the results of this work to 2015.  \n\n15. \nIn  addition,  the  Co-Chairs  informed  the  ADP  of  the  calls  from  Parties  for  textual \nnegotiations.  In  this  context,  the  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to  make  specific \nsuggestions that seek to build bridges and clarify options so as to allow the contact group to \ncollectively  advance  its  work  towards  a  draft  negotiating  text.  In  the  light  of  the  limited \ntime  available  to  the  ADP  to  advance  this  work,  the  Co-Chairs  proposed  that  focused \nnegotiations in the contact group on the elements for a draft negotiating text be undertaken \nin parallel and facilitated by either one of the Co-Chairs.  \n\n16.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  recalled  the  work  undertaken  by  the  ADP  on \ndraft decision texts on the identification of the information that Parties  will provide when \nputting forward their INDCs and on accelerating the implementation of enhanced pre-2020 \nclimate action. The Co-Chairs proposed that the contact group continue its work on these \nissues  through  textual  negotiations  with  a  view  to  agreeing  on  a  draft  decision  to  be \nrecommended for consideration and adoption at COP 20.  \n\n17. \nThe Co-Chairs further drew the attention of delegates to the updated technical paper \ntitled “Updated compilation of information on the mitigation benefits of actions, initiatives \nand options to enhance mitigation ambition”,10 prepared by the secretariat as requested by \nthe  ADP  at  the  third  part  of  its  second  session.11  The  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to \nread  the  updated  technical  paper  and  to  bring  it  to  the  attention  of  the  relevant \nimplementation officials in their respective governments.  \n\n18. \nIn  the  context  of  pre-2020  action,  the  Co-Chairs  also  informed  the  ADP  of  their \nrequest to the secretariat to cluster and enhance the visibility of side events and exhibits in \nLima  that  were  directly  relevant  to  the  thematic  areas  explored  by  the  technical  expert \nmeetings in 2014, and that further information on these events and exhibits was available \non the UNFCCC website.12 \n\n19.  At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the attention of delegates to the high-level \nministerial  dialogue  on  climate  finance  and  the  high-level  ministerial  dialogue  on  the \nDurban  Platform  for  Enhanced  Action,  which  were  to  be  held  on  9  and  10  December, \nrespectively.  They  expressed  their  appreciation  to  Mr.  Manuel  Pulgar-Vidal,  President  of \nCOP 20 and the tenth session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the \nParties to the Kyoto  Protocol (CMP), and his team  for the great efforts  made to facilitate \nthe ADP process. \n\n8  ADP.2014.11.NonPaper. \n9  ADP.2014.12.DraftText. \n10  FCCC/TP/2014/13 and Add.1–4.  \n11  FCCC/ADP/2013/3, paragraph 30(c)(ii). \n12  <http://unfccc.int/bodies/awg/items/8682.php>.  \n\n4 \n\n \n \n                                                           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\x0cFCCC/ADP/2014/4 \n\n20. \nThe  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to  attend  the  numerous  briefings,  forums  and \nevents  on  areas  of  relevance  to  the  work  of  the  ADP  being  held  in  Lima  and  informed \ndelegates that a list of these events was available on the UNFCCC website.13 \n\n21.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  ADP  agreed  to  the  proposals  by  the  Co-Chairs  on  the \norganization of work by the ADP on item 3.  \n\n22. \nThe  ADP  met  on  6  December  to  take  stock  of  progress  made  and  to  consider  the \npossible way forward. Further to this informal meeting and in response to an invitation by \nthe President of COP 20/CMP 10, on 8 December the Co-Chairs issued a revised version of \nthe draft decision text referred to in paragraph 16 above and of the draft text containing the \nelements  for  a  draft  negotiating  text.  At  the  request  of  Parties,  a  compilation  of  textual \ninputs received from Parties14 was made available on the UNFCCC website.15 \n\n23. \nFollowing the stocktaking meeting and the issuance of the draft texts referred to in \nparagraph  22  above,  the  ADP  further  focused  its  work,  including  through  line-by-line \nnegotiations  on  the  draft  decision  text  on  agenda  item  3.  The  progress  of  this  work  was \ncaptured in: \n\n(a) \n\nA  revised  version  of  the  draft  text  containing  the  elements  for  a  draft \n\nnegotiating text, issued on 10 December;  \n\n(b) \n\nRevised  versions  of  the  draft  decision  text  on  agenda  item  3  reflecting  the \nstatus  of  the  negotiations,  made  available  on  the  UNFCCC  website  on  9,  10  and  11 \nDecember.16 \n\n24. \nProgress was also reflected in the oral reports by the ADP Co-Chairs to the informal \nstocktaking  plenaries  convened  by  the  President  of  COP 20/CMP 10  on  10,  11  and  12 \nDecember. \n\n25. \nIn  addition  to  the  consultations  with  Parties  undertaken  by  the  President  of \nCOP 20/CMP  10  and  the  ongoing  ADP  negotiations,  on  12  December  the  President \nlaunched  ministerial  consultations  on  ADP  issues  facilitated  on  his  behalf  by  ministers \nVivian Balakrishnan (Singapore) and Tine Sundtoft (Norway) with a view to facilitating a \nsuccessful outcome of the ADP process. \n\n26.  On 13 December, the Co-Chairs convened an informal ADP meeting to introduce a \nfurther revised draft decision on agenda item 3 with an annex containing the elements for a \ndraft negotiating text referred to in paragraph 23(a) above.17 \n\n27.  On  the  same  day,  the  Co-Chairs  opened  the  14th  plenary  meeting  and  invited  the \nADP to consider the draft decision referred to in paragraph 26 above.  \n\n28.  At  the  beginning  of  the  meeting,  the  President  of  COP 20/CMP 10  recalled  the \nexpectations for a successful outcome of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in \nLima,  which  would  provide  a  solid  foundation  for  reaching  an  agreement  in  Paris.  The \nPresident  called  for  flexibility  and  encouraged  Parties  to  work  together  to  achieve  the \nsuccessful outcome needed.  \n\n29. \nStatements  were  made  by  representatives  of  41  Parties,  including  on  behalf  of  the \nEnvironmental Integrity Group, the African Group, the European Union and its 28 member \nStates,  the  LDCs,  AILAC,  the  Like-minded  Developing  Countries,  the  League  of  Arab \nStates and the BASIC countries. \n\n13  <http://unfccc.int/files/bodies/awg/application/pdf/lima_conference_adp_relevant_events.pdf>. \n14  <http://unfccc.int/bodies/awg/items/8757.php>. \n15  <http://unfccc.int/files/bodies/awg/application/pdf/compilation_of_inputs.pdf>. \n16  <http://unfccc.int/bodies/awg/items/8743.php>.  \n17  FCCC/ADP/2014/L.5. \n\n5 \n\n \n \n \n                                                           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\x0cFCCC/ADP/2014/4 \n\n2.

At  the  same  meeting,  Parties  agreed  that  an  additional  tool  was  needed  for  the \npreparations  for  the  tenth  part  of  the  session.  They  requested  the  Co-Chairs,  with  the \nsupport  of  the  secretariat  and  the  co-facilitators,  to  make  available  to  Parties  “a  single \ndocument based on the structure of annex II to the scenario note of 5 May 2015, guided by \nthe  views  expressed  by  Parties  during  the  8  June  stocktaking  meeting,  taking  fully  into \naccount  the  discussions  in  the  75  meetings  of  the  ADP  negotiating  groups  as  well  as  the \nfacilitation  groups.  It  will  include  a  fully  streamlined,  consolidated,  clear  and  concise \nversion of the Geneva negotiating text27 that will present clear options and will not omit or \ndelete  any  option  or  position  of  Parties.  It  will  separate  paragraphs  of  the  Geneva \nnegotiating text that are, by their nature, obviously appropriate for inclusion in a draft COP \ndecision from paragraphs that are, by their nature, obviously appropriate for inclusion in the \nParis  agreement.  Issues  clearly  requiring  further  substantive  negotiation  among  Parties  to \ndetermine  their  placement  will  remain  in  the  streamlined,  consolidated,  clear  and  concise \nGeneva negotiating text without inclusion in either category and will be clearly identified.” \nIn  order  to  further  advance  the  negotiations  on  workstream  2,  the  Co-Chairs  will  also \n\n19  <http://unfccc.int/8987.php>. \n20  <http://unfccc.int/8857.php>. \n21  <http://unfccc.int/8987.php>. \n22  See <http://unfccc.int/8895.php>. \n23  See <http://unfccc.int/8896.php>. \n24  See <http://unfccc.int/files/bodies/awg/application/pdf/adp2-\n9_briefing_points_from_sbi_chair20150604_final.pdf>. \n25  See <http://unfccc.int/files/bodies/awg/application/pdf/adp2-\n9_briefing_points_from_sbsta_chair20150604_final.pdf>. \n\n26  Available at <http://unfccc.int/8857.php>. \n27   FCCC/ADP/2015/1. \n\n4 \n\n \n                                                           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\x0cFCCC/ADP/2015/3 \n\nprepare a document with elements for a draft decision on workstream 2 of the ADP as a key \npiece of the package to be considered at the Paris Conference.  \n\n17. \nThe  Co-Chairs  invited  the  secretariat  to  provide  delegates  with  information  on  the \nadministrative  and  budgetary  implications  of,  and  on  the  status  of  funding  for,  holding \nadditional sessions of the ADP in 2015.

The organization \nof the work on agenda item 3 included a contact group established at the fourth part of the \nsession,9 a briefing on support for domestic preparations for intended nationally determined \ncontributions  (INDCs)  and  a  dedicated  meeting  on  ways  and  means  to  advance  the \ntechnical  examination  process  in  2015.  The  ADP  decided  to  proceed  on  the  basis  of  the \norganization of work proposed by the Co-Chairs. \n\n10.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  stressed  the  importance  of  time  management \nand of collaboration among Parties for the success of the collective work at this session.  \n\n11. \nIn  addition,  the  Co-Chairs  held  a  special  event  with  observer  organizations  during \nthe session, on 12 February.10 Representatives of observer organizations welcomed the new \nADP Co-Chairs, and expressed interest in continuing such special events in 2015. The ADP \nCo-Chairs  underscored  the  intergovernmental  nature  of  the  ADP  and  its  work,  and \nencouraged  observer  organizations  to  bring  forward  ideas  to  governments  for  further \nengaging in the process and strengthening implementation. \n\nIII.  Implementation of all the elements of decision 1/CP.17 \n\n(Agenda item 3) \n\nThe  ADP  considered  this  agenda  item  at  its  15th  meeting,  as  well  as  at  its  16th \n12. \nmeeting, held on 13 February. It had before it decision 1/CP.20, the report of the ADP on \nthe seventh part of its second session,11 and the informal note prepared for the eighth part of \nthe session.12 \n\n13.  At  the  15th  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  recalled  that  the  COP  requested  the  ADP  to \nintensify its work with a view to making available a negotiating text for a protocol, another \nlegal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to \n\n5  FCCC/ADP/2013/2, paragraphs 8 and 9. \n6  ADP.2015.1.InformalNote. \n7  Decision 1/CP.19. \n8  Decision 1/CP.20. \n9  FCCC/ADP/2014/1, paragraph 19. \n10  See ADP.2015.1.InformalNote, paragraph 19. \n11  FCCC/ADP/2014/4. \n12  ADP.2015.1.InformalNote. \n\n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n                                                           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\x0cFCCC/ADP/2015/2 \n\nall  Parties  before  May  2015.13  The  Co-Chairs  reminded  Parties  that  this  negotiating  text \nwas  to  be  derived  from  the  annex  to  decision  1/CP.20,  titled  “Lima  Call  for  Climate \nAction.” They noted that this text was to fully reflect the positions of all Parties. \n\nIn accordance with this deadline, the Co-Chairs stressed their commitment to deliver \n14. \nand make available the negotiating text of the 2015 agreement by the closing plenary, on 13 \nFebruary. \n\nThe Co-Chairs called upon the ADP to streamline the text’s language and eliminate \n15. \nredundancies  and  duplications,  better  present  alternatives  and  divergences,  and  clarify,  to \nthe extent possible, proposals and concepts contained therein. \n\n16. \nIn the interest of further refining the text over the course of future sessions, the Co-\nChairs  encouraged  Parties  to  consider  what  language  in  the  existing  text  might  be  most \nsuitable  for  the  agreement,  and  what  might  be  more  appropriate  for  accompanying \ndecisions. \n\n17. \nThe  ADP  worked  sequentially  through  the  language  of  the  annex  to  decision \n1/CP.20 in an effort to develop the negotiating text. Each section was updated and further \nrevised as requested by Parties, in an open and transparent manner.  Each revised iteration \nof the text was made available on the UNFCCC website. On 12 February, the sections were \nconsolidated into a single document and made available as an advance unedited version on \nthe UNFCCC website.14 \n\n18. \nFurther, in the context of its work on agenda item 3, the contact group referred to in \nparagraph  9  above  held  meetings  to  explore  broader  substantive  questions  related  to  the \n2015 agreement and ideas on how to make significant progress in the June session.15 The \nCo-Chairs informed Parties of their intention to issue a scenario note in order to facilitate \npreparations for that June session. \n\n19. \nIn  the  context  of  work  on  pre-2020  climate  action,  including  on  how  to  further \nadvance workstream 2, the contact group exchanged views on how to implement decision \n1/CP.19,  in  particular  paragraphs  3–5,  and  decision  1/CP.20,  in  particular  paragraphs  17–\n20.  The  ADP  held  a  dedicated  meeting  on  how  to  advance  the  technical  examination \nprocess on 10 February.16  \n\n20.

At its 2nd meeting, the SBI considered and adopted the conclusions below.11 \n\n2.  Conclusions \n\n21. \nThe  SBI  welcomed  the  information  provided  by  the  secretariat  of  the  Global \nEnvironment  Facility  (GEF)  on  the  financial  support  provided  by  the  GEF  for  the \npreparation  of  biennial  update  reports  (BURs)  by  Parties  not  included  in  Annex  I  to  the \nConvention (non-Annex I Parties).12  \n\n22. \nThe  SBI  invited  the  GEF  to  continue  providing  detailed,  accurate,  timely  and \ncomplete  information  on  its  activities  relating  to  the  preparation  of  BURs,  including \ninformation on the dates of requests for funding, approval and disbursement of funds,  and \nan approximate date of submission of BURs to the secretariat, for consideration at SBI 43. \n\n23. \nThe  SBI  noted  with  appreciation  that  10  non-Annex  I  Parties  had  submitted  their \nfirst BURs by December 2014 and welcomed the three additional BURs submitted between \n1 January and 8 June 2015. A further 18 non-Annex I Parties are expected to submit their \nfirst BURs by 31 December 2015.  \n\n24. \nThe  SBI  noted  that,  as  at  9  June  2015,  there  were  many  outstanding  BURs,  while \nrecognizing  the  challenges  that  non-Annex  I  Parties  face  in  submitting  their  BURs  in  a \ntimely manner. It recalled decision 2/CP.17, paragraph 41(a), which states that non-Annex I \nParties,  consistent  with  their  capabilities  and  the  level  of  support  provided  for  reporting, \nshould  submit  their  first  BURs  by  December  2014.  The  SBI  encouraged  non-Annex  I \nParties that  have not  submitted their first BURs to complete  and submit them  in a timely \nmanner. \n\n25. \nThe  SBI  also  noted  that,  as  at  29  May  2015,  the  GEF  secretariat  had  received  51 \nrequests for funds from non-Annex I Parties for the preparation of their BURs, and that an \numbrella  programme  for  BURs  implemented  by  the  United  Nations  Environment \nProgramme (UNEP) seeks to support 39 additional non-Annex I Parties in preparing their \nfirst BURs.  \n\n26. \nThe SBI recalled decision 2/CP.17, paragraph 41(d), through which the COP urged \nnon-Annex I Parties that have not submitted their requests to the GEF for financial support \nfor the preparation of their first BURs to do so in a timely manner. It also encouraged GEF \nagencies  to  continue  to  facilitate  the  preparation  and  submission  of  project  proposals  by \nnon-Annex I Parties for the preparation of their BURs. \n\n27. \nThe  SBI  noted  with  appreciation  the  operationalization  by  the  GEF  of  its  Global \nSupport  Programme  (GSP).13  It  continued  to  encourage  non-Annex  I  Parties  to  take \nadvantage of the opportunities for technical assistance and support available under the GSP \nregarding  the  preparation  of  their  national  communications  and  BURs,  including  the \nrequests referred to in paragraph 29 below. \n\n10  An update provided by a representative of the Global Environment Facility on this agenda sub-item is \n\navailable at <www.unfccc.int/8854>.  \n\n11  Draft conclusions presented in document FCCC/SBI/2015/L.8.  \n12  FCCC/SBI/2015/INF.7. \n13  A project administered jointly by the United Nations Development Programme and UNEP with the \n\nobjective of enhancing the support provided to non-Annex I Parties for the timely preparation of their \nnational communications and BURs. \n\n10 \n\n \n \n                                                           \n \n \n \n \n\x0cFCCC/SBI/2015/10 \n\n28. \nThe SBI recognized the contribution made by the Consultative Group of Experts on \nNational  Communications  from  Parties  not  included  in  Annex  I  to  the  Convention  in \nproviding  technical  support  to  non-Annex  I  Parties  through  the  development  of  updated \ntraining materials and e-learning programmes.  \n\n29. \nThe  SBI noted the requests  from non-Annex I Parties for further technical  support \naimed  at  improving  their  domestic  capacity  to  facilitate  continuity  in  meeting  reporting \nrequirements  through  training  on  the  use  of  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate \nChange (IPCC) 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, building \nsustainable national greenhouse gas inventory management systems, and understanding and \napplying best practices relevant to the  setting  up of domestic  measurement,  reporting and \nverification  systems.  It  encouraged  the  secretariat,  in  coordination  with  UNEP  and  the \nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP), to make every effort to ensure that the \nrelevant training is made available to all non-Annex I Parties.  \n\n30. \nThe  SBI  took  note  of  the  estimated  budgetary  implications  of  the  activities  to  be \nundertaken by the secretariat referred to in paragraph 29 above. It requested that the actions \nof the secretariat called for in these conclusions be undertaken subject to the availability of \nfinancial resources. \n\nV.

At the resumed 1st meeting, the issue of the \nfinalization of the nominations for membership of the Executive Committee of the Warsaw \nInternational  Mechanism  for  Loss  and  Damage  associated  with  Climate  Change  Impacts \nwas  raised,  as  well  as  the  issue  of  the  consideration  of  the  3rd  review  of  the  Adaptation \nFund. At the same meeting, the Chair proposed undertaking general consultations on those \nissues and reporting back on the outcome thereof to the SBI at its closing meeting. \n\n153.  At  the  2nd  meeting,  the  Chair  reported  on  the  outcome  of  his  consultations,  as \ndetailed in paragraphs 154-157 below. \n\n154.  The issue of the finalization of the nominations to the Executive Committee of the \nWarsaw International Mechanism was raised at the Bureau meeting of 3 June. The Bureau \nappointed  the  COP  Vice-President,  Mr.  Cheik  Sylla  (Senegal),  to  consult  on  this  issue  as \npart of the overall consultations on nominations for elections that he had been designated to \nconduct by the COP President. \n\n155.  During  his  consultations  on  elections  with  the  Chairs  of  all  regional  groups  and \nconstituencies held on 9 June, Mr. Sylla requested all groups to urgently finalize and submit \nthe pending nominations by the closing of the sessions in Bonn.  \n\n156.  The SBI Chair confirmed that all  nominations  for  non-Annex I  Parties  and Parties \nincluded in Annex I to the Convention have now been submitted and thanked all Parties for \n\n27 \n\n \n\x0cFCCC/SBI/2015/10 \n\ntheir nominations, as well as Mr. Sylla for his efforts in securing them.80 Arrangements for \nconvening the first meeting of the Executive Committee can now be made. \n\n157.  The Chair informed the SBI that, in accordance with decision 2/CMP.10, the SBI is \nrequested  to  initiate  the  3rd  review  of  the  Adaptation  Fund  at  SBI  44  and  report  back  to \nCMP 12 on the outcomes of its deliberations. \n\n  XVII.  Closure of and report on the session \n\n(Agenda item 17) \n\n1.  Administrative and budgetary implications \n\n158.  At  the  2nd  meeting,  a  representative  of  the  secretariat  provided  a  preliminary \nevaluation  of  the  administrative  and  budgetary  implications  of  the  conclusions  adopted \nduring the session in accordance with rule 15 of the draft rules of procedure being applied. \n\n159.  The  secretariat  informed  Parties  that  a  number  of  activities  had  arisen  from  the \nnegotiations at the session that call for the provision of more support by the secretariat and, \ntherefore,  require  additional  resources  over  and  above  the  core  budget  for  2015  and  the \nproposed budget for 2016–2017, as detailed below. \n\n160.  Under  agenda  sub-item  3(c),  the  secretariat  has  been  requested  to  organize  a  pre-\nsession workshop prior to SBI 44 and to revise and update a technical paper on the revision \nof the UNFCCC reporting guidelines on NCs. The estimated cost amounts to EUR 58,000. \n\n161.  Under agenda sub-item 4(b), the secretariat has been requested to make every effort \nto provide training on the use of the  2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas \nInventories  to all non-Annex  I Parties. The estimated cost  amounts  to EUR 1,359,000, of \nwhich EUR 160,000 will be needed in 2015. \n\n162.  Under agenda sub-items 9(a) and (b), the secretariat has been requested to organize a \nworkshop back-to-back with an ADP session to discuss how to enhance capacity-building, \nwith  a  report  thereon  to  be  prepared  for  consideration  at  SBI  43.  The  estimated  cost \namounts to EUR 47,000.  \n\n163.  The  SBI  has  given  the  secretariat  further  mandates  in  addition  to  those  referred  to \nabove.  However,  the  corresponding  resource  requirements  will  be  absorbed  by  available \nresources. The above-stated amounts are  preliminary and based on the  currently  available \ninformation. Overall, additional funds amounting to EUR 1,464,000 will be needed to cover \nactivities in the current year and the 2016–2017 biennium.  \n\n164. \nIn addition to the administrative and budgetary implications of the requests made by \nthe SBI at the session, the secretariat noted the implications of the outcome of the session \nfor the biennial programme budget recommended by the SBI for adoption by the COP and \nthe  CMP.  Parties  could  not  agree  to  cover  the  increased  resource  requirements  that  the \nExecutive Secretary had proposed for inclusion in the core budget and the secretariat urged \nParties  in  a  position  to  do  so  to  provide  supplementary  funding  to  meet  the  additional \nrequirements  for:  additional  meetings  of  the  constituted  bodies,  as  the  core budget  can  in \nthe biennium 2016–2017 accommodate only two meetings of each body rather than three; \nreviews of greenhouse gas inventories, to cover in-country reviews and reviews of a higher \nnumber of BURs; strengthening the Adaptation programme in the area of loss and damage, \nthe  Adaptation Committee and  the NAP process; organizing side events and exhibits; and \n\n80  See <http://unfccc.int/adaptation/cancun_adaptation_framework/loss_and_damage/items/8806.php>.  \n\n28 \n\n \n                                                           \n \n\x0cFCCC/SBI/2015/10 \n\ninstitutional strengthening, in particular information technology (IT) security and other key \nIT and communication functions. \n\n2.  Closure of and report on the session \n\n165.  At its 2nd meeting, the SBI considered and adopted the draft report on the session81 \nand authorized the Rapporteur, with the assistance of the secretariat and under the guidance \nof the Chair, to complete the report on the session and to make it available to all Parties.  \n\n166.  Closing  statements  were  made  by  representatives  of  seven  Parties,  including  on \nbehalf  of  the  African  Group  of  Negotiators,  EIG,  G77  and  China,  the  Umbrella  Group, \nAOSIS,  the  LDCs  and  the  European  Union  and  its  member  States.  Statements  were  also \nmade  by  representatives  of  indigenous  peoples  organizations,  environmental  NGOs, \nwomen  and  gender  NGOs,  business  and  industry  NGOs  and  youth  NGOs.  The  Chair \nthanked Parties for their support and closed the session. \n\n81  FCCC/SBI/2015/L.1.  \n\n29 \n\n \n \n \n                                                           \n \n\x0cFCCC/SBI/2015/10 \n\nAnnex I  \n\n[English only] \n\nSummary reports on multilateral assessments at the forty-second \nsession of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation \n\nBackground \n\n1. \nThe Conference of the Parties, by decision 1/CP.16, decided that developed country \nParties should enhance the reporting in their national communications and submit biennial \nreports on their progress in achieving emission reductions. It also established a new process \nunder the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) – international assessment and review \n(IAR)  –  that  aims  to  promote  the  comparability  of  efforts  among  all  developed  country \nParties. The first round of the IAR process is to be conducted during the period 2014–2015. \n\n2. \nAccording to the modalities and procedures for IAR specified in annex II to decision \n2/CP.17,  the  multilateral  assessment  (MA),  being  part  of  the  IAR  process,  is  to  be \nconducted for each developed country Party at a working group session of the SBI, with the \nparticipation  of  all  Parties.  The  aim  of  the  MA  is  to  assess  each  Party’s  progress  in \nimplementation towards the achievement of emission reductions and removals related to its \nquantified economy-wide emission reduction target. \n\n3. \nThe  second  MA  working  group  session  was  convened  during  SBI  42  under  the \nchairmanship  of  Mr.  Amena  Yauvoli  (Fiji),  the  SBI  Chair,  and  was  preceded  by  a  three-\nmonth period of questions and answers; in the first  month, any Party  may  submit  written \nquestions  to  the  Party  being  assessed,  which  may  respond  to  the  questions  within  the \nremaining two months. A summary report for each of the  24 Parties that were assessed at \nSBI 42 is presented below. The reports are also available on the UNFCCC website  on the \nindividual Party pages.1  \n\n4. \nIn  closing  the  MA  for  each  Party,  the  SBI  Chair  reminded  the  Party  that  it  can \nsubmit any other observations on its MA process within two months of the working group \nsession, and that they will form part of its Party record for the MA. The SBI Chair thanked \nall Parties and the secretariat for the successful MA working group session. \n\n1  See <www.unfccc.int/8451>. \n\n30 \n\n                                                           \n \n\x0cFCCC/SBI/2015/10 \n\nSummary report on multilateral assessment of Australia \n\nThe first MA of Australia took place on 4 June 2015. Australia was represented by \n\n1. \nMr. Peter Woolcott, Ambassador for the Environment. \n\n2. \nQuestions  for  Australia  had  been  submitted  in  writing  two  months  before  the \nworking  group  session  by  Brazil,  China,  the  European  Union  (EU),  New  Zealand,  Saudi \nArabia, Switzerland and the United States of America. A list of the questions received and \nthe answers provided by Australia can be found on the IAR web page for Australia.1  \n\n3. \nMr.  Woolcott  made  an  opening  presentation,  summarizing  Australia’s  progress  in \nimplementation towards the achievement of emission reductions and removals related to its \nquantified  economy-wide  emission  reduction  targets.  He  also  provided  an  update  on \nAustralia’s  recent  policy  changes  concerning  emission  reductions.  According  to  Mr. \nWoolcott,  Australia  is  on  track  to  meet  its  2020  target,  which  is  5  per  cent  below  2000 \nemission  levels  by  2020.  Based  on  its  2015  national  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  inventory \nreport,  Australia  overachieved  its  target  for  the  first  commitment  period  of  the  Kyoto \nProtocol  by  129  million  tonnes  (Mt)  of  carbon  dioxide  equivalent  (CO2  eq).  In  addition, \nAustralia  has  advanced  towards  its  2020  target  through  policy  interventions,  such  as  the \nimprovement  in  energy  efficiency  and  the  facilitation  of  changes  of  the  economy.  A \ncomparison  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  and  population  growth  with  emission \nintensity of GDP and emissions per capita shows that Australia has decoupled its emissions \nfrom GDP and population growth. \n\nIn his presentation, Mr. Woolcott elaborated on the implementation of the Emissions \n4. \nReduction Fund (ERF), the central piece of the 2014 Direct Action Plan, which replaced the \nformer  carbon  tax.  The  ERF  is  the  main  mechanism  for  achieving  the  2020  target  and  it \naims to tackle economy-wide mitigation potential. The first auction under the ERF was held \nin  April  2015,  with  over  47  Mt  CO2  eq  abatement  contracted.  A  safeguard  mechanism  is \nplanned to be put in place to ensure that emission reductions purchased by the Government \nunder  the  ERF  are  not  offset  by  significant  rises  in  emissions  elsewhere  in  the  economy. \nApart from the ERF, policies and measures (PaMs) in place to meet Australia’s 2020 target \ninclude  the  amended  Renewable  Energy  Target,  energy  efficiency  measures  and  the \nNational Energy Productivity Plan.  \n\n5. \nThe opening presentation was followed by interventions and questions from  Brazil, \nChina,  Fiji,  Japan,  New  Zealand,  the  Republic  of  Korea,  Saudi  Arabia,  Switzerland,  the \nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (United Kingdom), and the United \nStates. These questions were on: the mitigation potential of the ERF; lessons learned from \nthe  first  auction  under  the  ERF  and  companies’  reaction  to  the  ERF;  the  mechanism  to \nmonitor the effectiveness of the ERF; the rigour of the safeguard mechanism and key issues \nraised  during  the  public  consultation  stage  of  the  mechanism;  the  conditionality  and \nambition  of  Australia’s  2020  target;  the  role  of  updated  GHG  emission  projections  in \npolicymaking;  difficulties  in  estimating  policy  effects  by  gas;  the  Renewable  Energy \nTarget;  and  the  vehicle  emission  standard  as  part  of  the  policy  package  towards  2020. \nQuestions were also raised in relation to Australia’s assessment of the social and economic \nconsequences  of  response  measures.  In  response,  Australia  provided  further  explanations. \nDetails can be found in the webcast of this session on the IAR web page for Australia. \n\n1  <http://unfccc.int/8814.php>. \n\n31 \n\n \n                                                           \n \n\x0cFCCC/SBI/2015/10 \n\nSummary report on multilateral assessment of Belgium \n\nThe  first  MA  of  Belgium  took  place  on  3 June  2015.  Belgium  was  represented  by \n1. \nMr. Peter Wittoeck, Head of Climate Change Section, Federal Directorate-General for the \nEnvironment. \n\nQuestions  for  Belgium  had  been  submitted  in  writing  two  months  before  the \n2. \nworking group session by Brazil, Canada, China, New Zealand and the United States. A list \nof the  questions received and the answers provided by Belgium can be found on the IAR \nweb page for Belgium.1  \n\nMr.  Wittoeck  made  an  opening  presentation,  summarizing  Belgium’s  progress \n3. \ntowards  the  achievement  of  its  quantified  economy-wide  emission  reduction  targets. \nEmissions,  excluding  those  from  the  land  use,  land-use  change  and  forestry  (LULUCF) \nsector,  decreased  by  18.5  per  cent  between  1990  and  2012  despite  growth  in  GDP  and \npopulation over the same period. The emission intensity of the economy has thus decreased \nover  this  period,  indicating  a  certain  decoupling  of  emissions  from  economic  growth. \nAccording  to  Mr.  Wittoeck,  Belgium  is  expected  to  achieve  its  target  for  the  first \ncommitment period of the Kyoto Protocol.  \n\nMr.  Wittoeck  presented  Belgium’s  target  for  2020  for  sectors  outside  the  EU \n4. \nEmissions  Trading  System  (EU  ETS)  as  well  as  the  common  EU  target  for  EU  ETS  as \ncontained in the EU 2020 climate and energy package. Belgium has put in place a range of \npolicies  and  measures  in  order  to  achieve  its  2020  target,  including  for  the  renewable \nenergy,  building  and  transport  sectors.  Its  National  Climate  Policy  is  formulated  using  a \nbottom-up approach – it is based on regional and federal climate policies.  \n\n5. \nThe opening presentation was followed by interventions and questions from Algeria, \nBrazil, China, India and the United States. The questions were on: shares of transport and \ncommercial  sectors  in  Belgium’s  GHG  emissions;  the  inclusion  of  emissions  from \ninternational  aviation  in  the  2020  targets;  the  key  policies  and  measures  for  the  energy \nsector,  in  particular  as  related  to  the  transport  and  commercial  sectors;  policies  and \nmeasures  for  the  agriculture  and  waste  sectors,  including  those  planned  to  increase \nmitigation in the agriculture sector; and the quantification of impacts of mitigation policies \nand measures with the greatest contribution  to the achievement of Belgium’s 2020 targets \nand  their  main  focus  in  the  future.  Clarification  was  also  requested  on  how  Belgian \ndomestic energy policy fits into the EU energy policy, division of mitigation effort between \nfederal and regional levels, and how the Belgian National Climate Policy takes into account \nfederal  and  regional  policies.  Belgium  was  furthermore  asked  to  clarify  how  it  plans  to \ncreate incentives for other EU member States to undertake greater mitigation efforts in view \nof  the  downward  trend  in  its  own  emissions  since  2005.  In  response,  Belgium  provided \nfurther  explanations.

Bulgaria  was  represented  by \n\n1. \nMs. Veneta Borikova from the Ministry of Environment and Water. \n\n2. \nQuestions  for  Bulgaria  had  been  submitted  in  writing  two  months  before  the \nworking  group  session  by  Brazil  and  China.  A  list  of  the  questions  received  and  the \nanswers provided by Bulgaria can be found on the IAR web page for Bulgaria.1  \n\n3. \nMs.  Borikova  made  an  opening  presentation,  summarizing  Bulgaria’s  progress \ntowards  the  achievement  of  its  quantified  economy-wide  emission  reduction  targets. \nEmissions,  excluding  those  from  the  LULUCF  sector,  decreased  by  nearly  41  per  cent \nbetween 1988 and 2012  mainly owing to structural changes stemming from the  transition \nfrom a centrally-planned economy to a market economy.  \n\n4. \nMs. Borikova presented Bulgaria’s individual targets for 2020 for sectors outside the \nEU ETS and renewable energy set under the EU climate and energy package. Bulgaria has \nput in place a range of policies and measures in order to achieve its 2020 targets as part of \nits Third National Action Plan on Climate Change, including for the energy, household and \nservices,  waste  and  transport  sectors.  According  to  preliminary  estimates,  Bulgaria  is \nexpected to over-achieve its 2013 targets for sectors not covered by the EU ETS (non-ETS \nsectors), as well as its targets for renewable energy and biofuels under the EU climate and \nenergy package. \n\nThe opening presentation  was followed by interventions and questions  from  China \n5. \nand the Marshall Islands. Bulgaria was requested to clarify whether it would consider the \npossibility of raising its target under the EU climate and energy package in order to allow \nthe EU to raise its target for 2020 in view of the significant projected reductions in national \nemissions  compared  with  the  1990  levels.  Information  was  also  sought  regarding  the \nrelationship of Bulgaria’s Climate Change Mitigation Act  with its Energy Act, Renewable \nEnergy  Act,  Energy  Efficiency  Act  and  National  Climate  Action  Plan.  Another  question \nrelated to the time frame of Bulgaria’s plans for increased use of cleaner energy sources in \nplace  of  coal  for  power  generation  in  relation  to  the  time  frame  for  its  planned  move \ntowards a more electrified public transport system.  In response, Bulgaria provided further \nexplanations.

Canada  was  represented  by \n\n1. \nMs. Louise Métivier, Environment Canada. \n\n2. \nQuestions for Canada had been submitted in writing two months before the working \ngroup session by Brazil, China, the EU, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, Switzerland \nand  the  United  States.  Canada  submitted  written  answers  after  the  deadline.  A  list  of  the \nquestions received and the answers provided by Canada can be found on the IAR web page \nfor Canada.1  \n\nMs.  Métivier  made  an  opening  presentation,  summarizing  Canada’s  national \n3. \ncircumstances, the impacts of climate change felt in Canada, the institutional arrangements \nit  has  made  with  regard  to  its  climate  change  policy,  and  its  GHG  emission  trends  and \nprojections. She also summarized the steps  Canada  has taken towards the achievement of \nits  quantified  economy-wide  emission  reduction  target.  According  to  Ms.  Métivier,  the \nimplementation of current PaMs will contribute a reduction of 130 Mt of CO2 eq towards \nCanada’s  2020  target,  which  is  17 per  cent  below  2005  emission  levels  by  2020,  and  the \nParty  will  require  an  additional  reduction  of  116  Mt  CO2  eq  to  reach  the  target.  A \ncomparison  of  GHG  emission  growth  with  the  emission  intensity  of  GDP  shows  that \nCanada has achieved some level of decoupling of its emissions from GDP growth. \n\n4. \nMs. Métivier emphasized that Canada’s sector by sector regulatory approach focuses \non  the  two  most  polluting  sectors,  transportation  and  coal-fired  electricity  production. \nTransportation  emits  about  25  per  cent  of  Canada’s  total  emissions;  therefore,  Canada \nintends  to  develop  more  stringent  GHG  emission  standards  for  road  transportation. \nEmissions  from  coal-fired  electricity  production  are  addressed  by  federal  and  provincial \nmeasures phasing out coal-fired electricity generation over the long term. In addition, Ms. \nMétivier noted that Canada puts great effort into research, development and demonstration \nfor CO2 storage and sequestration and that the mitigation efforts of provinces and territories \nare making a significant contribution to meeting the national target. \n\n5. \nThe  opening  presentation  was  followed  by  interventions  and  questions  from \nAustralia, Brazil, China, the EU, Japan, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Sweden \nand the United States. These questions were on: the use of units from LULUCF and the use \nof  international  market-based  mechanisms  to  achieve  the  target;  ways  to  deliver  the \nrequired  116  Mt  CO2  eq  reductions  to  achieve  the  2020  target;  the  effects  of  current  and \nadditional  PaMs;  uncertainties  in  the  estimation  of  emissions/removals  in  the  LULUCF \nsector; new regulations in the electricity and transportation sectors; regulations addressing \nfluorinated gases; mapping the differences in the classification of economic sections versus \nthe sectoral classification used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; scale of \ninvestments  in  clean  technologies;  and  the  roles  of  provinces  and  territories  in  the \nimplementation of the climate change policy. Questions were also raised in relation to the \nParty’s  assessment  of  the  social  and  economic  consequences  of  response  measures.  In \nresponse, Canada provided further explanations.

The Czech Republic \n\n1. \nwas represented by Mr. Pavel Zamyslicky from the Ministry of the Environment. \n\n2. \nQuestions for Czech Republic had been submitted in writing two months before the \nworking  group session by  Brazil, Canada and  China.  A list of the  questions received and \nthe  answers  provided  by  the  Czech  Republic  can  be  found  on  the  IAR  web  page  for  the \nCzech Republic.1  \n\n3. \nMr. Zamyslicky  made an opening presentation, summarizing  the Czech  Republic’s \nprogress in the implementation of its emission reduction and removal commitments related \nto  its  quantified  economy-wide  emission  reduction  targets.  Under  the  Convention,  the \nCzech  Republic  participates  in  the  EU  joint  economy-wide  emission  reduction  target  to \nachieve a 20 per cent reduction in emissions by 2020 compared with the 1990 (base year) \nlevel.  The  target  for  the  EU  and  its  member  States  is  formalized  in  the  EU  climate  and \nenergy package, which includes the EU ETS and the effort-sharing decision (ESD). Under \nthe ESD, the Czech Republic has a target to limit emission growth to 9 per cent above the \n2005  level  by  2020  (+9  per  cent)  from  sectors  covered  by  the  ESD.  In  line  with  the  EU \napproach to its target, the Czech Republic does not include emissions or removals from the \nLULUCF  sector  in  defining  its  quantified  economy-wide  target.  The  ESD  also  includes \nbinding renewable energy goals and non-binding energy efficiency goals for each member \nState.  The  Czech  Republic  has  a  binding  renewable  energy  goal  to  achieve  a  13  per  cent \nshare  of  renewable  energy  in  its  gross  total  final  energy  consumption.  Its  non-binding \nenergy efficiency goal is to achieve additional energy savings of 13.27 TWh by 2020.  \n\n4. \nThe Czech Republic’s total GHG emissions excluding emissions and removals from \nLULUCF decreased by 31.5 per cent between 1990 and 2011, with projections showing a \ncontinuous decrease in emissions up to 2020. In order to meet its 2020 targets,  the Czech \nRepublic  is  currently  drafting  the  Climate  Protection  Policy,  which  will  include  the \nimplementation  of  the  EU  climate  and  energy  package,  as  well  as  its  emission  reduction \ntargets  for  2020  under  the  Convention.  In  addition,  the  Czech  Republic  is  preparing  the \nState Energy Policy, which includes a 30-year outlook for identifying energy management \nobjectives.  Across  the  EU,  it  is  expected  that  the  market  mechanism  of  the  EU  ETS  will \nguarantee that emissions from sectors under this scheme will achieve the 2020 target of 21 \nper cent below the 2005 level. Under the ESD, the Czech Republic is expected to meet its \nemission reduction target as well as its renewable energy and energy efficiency goals.  \n\n5. \nThe opening presentation was followed by interventions and questions from  Brazil, \nChina  and  the  United  States.  The  questions  received  focused  on:  whether  the  Czech \nRepublic is considering increasing its emission reduction target for 2020 since the current \ntarget has already been met; what, if any, market-based mechanisms will be used to achieve \nits targets; whether the Czech Republic is considering adopting additional PaMs to address \nits  emissions  not  covered  by  the  EU  ETS;  what  PaMs  addressing  the  implementation  of \nnew nuclear energy and other renewable energy sources (RES) are in place, and whether or \nnot  there  are  interim  targets  prior  to  2020  for  the  implementation  of  such  sources.  In \nresponse,  the  Czech  Republic  provided  further  explanations.

Estonia  was  represented  by \n\n1. \nMr. Meelis Münt from the Ministry of the Environment. \n\n2. \nQuestions for Estonia had been submitted in writing two months before the working \ngroup  session  by  Brazil  and  China.  A  list  of  the  questions  received  and  the  answers \nprovided by Estonia can be found on the IAR web page for Estonia.1  \n\n3. \nMr.  Münt  made  an  opening  presentation,  summarizing  Estonia’s  progress  in  the \nimplementation of its emission reduction and removal commitments related to its quantified \neconomy-wide emission reduction targets. He elaborated on the  national circumstances of \nEstonia  as  a  small  economy  and  member  State  of  the  EU.  Estonia  is  committed  to \ncontribute to the emission reduction target of the EU under the Convention and its Kyoto \nProtocol. Under the ESD, Estonia has a target of limiting the growth of its emissions in the \nnon-ETS sectors to 11 per cent by 2020 compared with the 2005 level (+11 per cent). He \nexplained  that  the  target  of  the  first  commitment  period  of  the  Kyoto  Protocol  had  been \noverachieved, with an emission reduction of 52.8 per cent in 2012 compared with the 1990 \nlevel. This  was partly due to  a decoupling of economic growth and  GHG emissions from \n1990  to  2012,  when  GDP,  after  an  initial  decline  in  the  1990s,  almost  doubled,  while \nemissions  halved.  Although  emissions  decreased  in  all  sectors,  the  most  significant \nreductions  could  be  observed  in  the  energy  and  agriculture  sectors.  However,  in  2012, \nenergy  remained  the  most  significant  sector  in  terms  of  GHG  emissions,  with  a  share  of \n87.9 per cent of the total. \n\n4. \nSuccessful  implementation  of  national  PaMs  has  led  to  a  transformation  of  the \nenergy  supply  structure  towards  an  increase  in  the  share  of  renewables  to  25  per  cent  in \ngross  final  energy  consumption  in  2014;  limitations  on  oil  shale  extraction  to  20  million \nt/year;  an  efficiency  improvement  in  the  use  of  oil  shale;  investments  in  climate  change \nmitigation  and  energy  efficiency  measures  of  more  than  EUR  700  million;  and \nenvironmental  taxation  reaching  2.8  per  cent  of  GDP.  In  addition,  several  strategies  and \nplans are under preparation to achieve the Party’s long-term targets, including the Estonian \nLow Carbon Road Map up to 2050, the Estonian National Development Plan of the Energy \nSector up to 2030, the National Development Plan for the Use of Oil Shale 2016–2020 and \nthe national Climate Change Adaptation Strategy up to 2030. Thus, Estonia projects further \nsignificant emission reductions and expects to fulfil its commitments for 2020.  \n\nThe opening presentation  was followed by interventions and questions  from  China \n5. \nand the Republic of Korea. The questions were on emission levels and trends in the energy \nand LULUCF sectors, and the specific measures to reduce GHG emissions in the industrial \nprocesses  and  agriculture  sectors.  In  response,  Estonia  provided  further  explanations. \nDetails can be found in the webcast of this session on the IAR web page for Estonia. \n\n1  <http://unfccc.int/8819.php>. \n\n36 \n\n                                                           \n \n\x0cFCCC/SBI/2015/10 \n\nSummary report on multilateral assessment of Germany \n\nThe first MA of Germany took place on 4 June 2015. Germany was represented by \n1. \nMr.  Martin  Weiß  from  the  Ministry  for  the  Environment,  Nature  Conservation,  Building \nand Nuclear Safety. \n\n2. \nQuestions  for  Germany  had  been  submitted  in  writing  two  months  before  the \nworking  group  session  by  Australia,  Brazil,  China,  New  Zealand,  Saudi  Arabia  and  the \nUnited States. A list of the questions received and the answers provided by Germany can be \nfound on the IAR web page for Germany.1  \n\nMr.  Weiß  made  an  opening  presentation,  summarizing  Germany’s  progress  in  the \n3. \nimplementation of its emission reduction and removal commitments related to its quantified \neconomy-wide emission reduction targets. He explained that Germany, as a member State \nof  the  EU,  has  a  target  under  the  ESD  to  reduce  its  emissions  in  the  non-ETS  sectors  by \n14 per  cent  by  2020  compared  with  the  2005  level.  In  addition,  Germany  has  a  national \ntarget of reducing its GHG emissions by 40 per cent by 2020 compared with the 1990 level. \nHe  also  described  the  targets  for  Germany’s  energy  transition  plan  for  the  period  up  to \n2050,  which  aims  to  reduce  GHG  emissions,  increase  the  share  of  renewable  energy  and \nimprove energy efficiency.  GHG emissions are estimated to be  27 per cent lower in 2014 \ncompared with 1990, a reduction that was achieved despite the economic growth of 39 per \ncent in the same period. All  sectors contributed to these emission reductions, with highest \nabsolute reductions in the energy sector and highest relative reductions in the waste sector \nas a result of the banning of landfilled waste.  \n\ntaxes, \n\nThe  main  PaMs  that  contributed  to  the  reduction  are  the  Renewable  Energy  Act, \n4. \nenergy \ntransport  efficiency  measures,  building  efficiency  measures  and \ncorresponding  support  programmes  and  all  EU-wide  mitigation  PaMs.  In  addition  to \nemission  reductions,  the  successful  implementation  of  these  PaMs  led  to  a  significant \ncreation  of  jobs  in  the  areas  of  renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency  technologies. \nAccording to the latest projections, Germany can achieve an emission reduction of 33–34 \nper cent by 2020 with existing PaMs. To close the gap to its national target of a 40 per cent \nreduction, the Federal Cabinet adopted the Climate  Action Programme 2020 in December \n2014. The programme is also considered an important milestone towards reaching its 2050 \ntarget  of  an  emission  reduction  of  80–95  per  cent,  as  it  outlines  the  process  for  the \nelaboration of the Climate Policy Plan 2050, to be developed by 2016. The development of \nthe Climate Policy Plan will be underpinned by a broad dialogue and participation  process \nduring 2015–2016 and will focus on long-term climate targets. \n\n5. \nThe opening presentation was followed by interventions and questions from  Brazil, \nChina,  Fiji,  Japan,  Maldives,  New  Zealand,  the  Republic  of  Korea,  Saudi  Arabia  and  the \nUnited States. The questions were on: clarification regarding Germany’s national target and \nthe target under the ESD, including their comparability and the potential effects of a more \nambitious national target on other EU member States; progress made in the optimization of \nthe  introduction  of  RES,  including  feed-in  tariffs  and  the  types  of  incentives  for  private \nhouseholds  for  installing  solar  energy  generation  devices;  the  PaMs  to  incentivize  and \nprotect  investments  for  energy  transformation;  specifics  of  the  PaMs  affecting  the  waste \nsector;  PaMs  affecting  shipping  emissions;  the  status  of  implementation  of  PaMs  in  the \nClimate Action Programme; drivers of emission trends in recent years; the projected share \nof  renewables  and  other  energy  sources  in  the  energy  mix  by  2020  and  the  Party’s \nexperiences  in  comparing  the  national  GHG  emission  inventory  with  external  data. \n\n1  <http://unfccc.int/8820.php>. \n\n37 \n\n \n                                                           \n \n\x0cFCCC/SBI/2015/10 \n\nQuestions were also raised in relation to Germany’s assessment of the social and economic \nconsequences of response  measures.

Greece  was  represented  by \n1. \nMr. Ioannis Ziomas, Advisor to the Minister of Environment, Energy and Climate Change. \n\n2. \nQuestions for Greece had been submitted in writing two months before the working \ngroup session by Brazil, China and the United States. A list of the questions received and \nthe answers provided by Greece can be found on the IAR web page for Greece.1  \n\n3. \nMr.  Ziomas  made  an  opening  presentation,  summarizing  Greece’s  progress  in  the \nimplementation of its emission reduction and removal commitments related to its quantified \neconomy-wide  emission reduction targets.  Under the  Convention,  Greece is committed to \nthe EU joint economy-wide emission reduction target to achieve a 20 per cent reduction in \nemissions by 2020 compared with the 1990 (base year) level. The target for the EU and its \nmember States is formalized in the 2020  EU climate and energy package, which includes \nthe EU ETS and the ESD. Under the ESD, Greece has an emission reduction target of 4 per \ncent below the 2005 level by 2020 for the sectors covered by the ESD. In line with the EU \napproach to its target, Greece does not include emissions or removals from LULUCF sector \nin defining its quantified economy-wide emission reduction target. The ESD also includes \nbinding  renewable  energy  goals  and  non-binding  energy  efficiency  goals  for  each  EU \nmember  State.  Greece  has  a  binding  renewable  energy  goal  of  achieving  an  18  per  cent \nshare of renewable energy in its gross total final energy consumption, which it voluntarily \nincreased  to  20  per  cent.  Regarding  energy  efficiency,  Greece  has  a  non-binding  goal  to \nlimit its final energy consumption to 18.4 Mtoe by 2020.  \n\n4. \nTo meet its 2020 targets, Greece has various PaMs in place, including the PaMs for \nthe promotion of RES and the promotion of natural gas. The PaM for the promotion of RES \nincludes  Greece’s  national  renewable  energy  action  plan  and  a  feed-in  tariff  for \nincentivizing  the  installation  of  renewable  energy.  Under  the  PaM  for  the  promotion  of \nnatural gas, Greece undertook a number of actions from 1996 to 2013, such as maintaining \nno  excise  duty,  developing  natural  gas  infrastructure  and  encouraging  fuel  switching. \nGreece’s emissions and removals for 2012 were estimated to be 5.8 per cent above the 1990 \nlevel excluding LULUCF,  with the  projections showing a  slight decrease  in emissions by \n2020  compared  with  the  1990  level.  Across  the  EU,  it  is  expected  that  the  market \nmechanism of  the EU ETS  will guarantee  that emissions  from  the  sectors  covered by the \nEU ETS will be in line with the 2020 target of 21 per cent below the 2005 level. Under the \nESD,  Greece  is  expected  to  meet  its  emission  reduction  target  as  well  as  its  renewable \nenergy and energy efficiency goals.  \n\n5. \nThe opening presentation was followed by interventions and questions from  Brazil, \nChina, India and the United States. The questions focused on: what domestic PaMs are in \nplace to fulfil Greece’s 2020 target for the non-ETS sectors; whether the economic situation \nin  Greece  has  the  potential  to  affect  its  climate  change  actions;  whether  Greece  will \ncontinue to  modify its  feed-in tariff rates to encourage renewable energy deployment and \nuse;  how  Greece  plans  to  address  the  rising  emissions  from  the  transport  sector;  and \nGreece’s  use of biodiesel and  whether it  will consider the  use of bioethanol.  In response, \nGreece provided further explanations.

Hungary  was represented by \n1. \nMr. Akos Lukacs, Head of Climate Policy Department, Ministry of National Development. \n\n2. \nQuestions  for  Hungary  had  been  submitted  in  writing  two  months  before  the \nworking  group  session  by  Brazil  and  China.  A  list  of  the  questions  received  and  the \nanswers provided by Hungary can be found on the IAR web page for Hungary.1  \n\n3. \nMr. Lukacs made an opening presentation, addressing the questions received prior to \nthe  working  group  session  and  the  answers  provided.  He  described  the  historical  and \nprojected impacts of climate change in Hungary for the period 1901–2100. In addition, he \nexplained the emission trends in Hungary for the period 1990–2012. He then elaborated on \nthe  national  circumstances  of  Hungary,  which  experienced  a  significant  reduction  (by  36 \nper cent during 1990–2012) in GHG emissions owing to the collapse of the central planning \neconomic system. In the period after 1992, Hungary demonstrated a significant economic \nrestructuring, reduction in energy intensity and decoupling of economic development from \nthe emission trajectory.  \n\n4. \nMr.  Lukacs  explained  that,  as  a  EU  member  State,  since  2004  Hungary  has  been \ncommitted to achieving a joint unconditional quantified economy-wide emission reduction \ntarget  of  20  per  cent  below  the  1990  level  by  2020.  This  target  is  formalized  in  the  EU \nclimate  and  energy  package,  which  includes  the  EU  ETS  and  the  ESD.  Under  the  ESD, \nHungary has committed to a target of limiting its emissions growth to 10 per cent compared \nwith  the  2005  level  by  2020.  In  2012,  emissions  from  sectors  covered  by  the  ESD  were \nalready 18 per cent below the 2005 level. Hungary appears to be on track to meet its target \nand is likely to overachieve it.  \n\n5. \nRegarding  the  progress  made  towards  achieving  the  2020  targets,  it  was \nacknowledged  that  a  number  of  PaMs  have  been  put  in  place  by  Hungary  to  address  its \njoint  EU  commitments  under  the  Convention  and  its  Kyoto  Protocol.  Hungary’s  major \nPaMs  include  its  National  Climate  Change  Strategies,  the  Decarbonisation  Roadmap,  the \nGreen Investment Scheme and the measures to promote the use of  RES, energy efficiency \nimprovements and an increase in the use of biofuels.  \n\n6. \nThe opening presentation was followed by questions from Algeria and China on the \nfollowing: the projected GHG emissions by 2020; PaMs included in the emission projection \nscenario  for  the  period  ending  in  2020;  and  institutional  arrangements  and  financial \nprovisions  made  for  the  implementation  of  those  PaMs.  In  response,  Hungary  provided \nfurther  explanations.

Iceland  was  represented  by \n1. \nMr. Hugi  Ólafsson,  Department  of  Oceans,  Water  and  Climate,  Ministry  for  the \nEnvironment and Natural Resources. \n\n2. \nQuestions for Iceland had been submitted in writing two months before the working \ngroup session by Brazil, Canada, China, the EU, New Zealand and the United States. A list \nof  the  questions  received  and  the  answers  provided  by  Iceland  can  be  found  on  the  IAR \nweb page for Iceland.1  \n\nMr. Ólafsson made an opening presentation, summarizing Iceland’s progress in the \n3. \nimplementation of its emission reduction and removal commitments related to its quantified \neconomy-wide emission reduction targets. Mr. Ólafsson highlighted Iceland’s unique GHG \nemission profile, where emissions from industrial processes are the major contributor to the \ntotal national GHG emissions without emissions from LULUCF. The total GHG emissions \nincreased by 26 per cent from 1990 to 2012. \n\n4. \nMr. Ólafsson noted that Iceland, jointly with the EU, participates in efforts to reach \nthe  economy-wide  emission  reduction  target  for  the  second  commitment  period  of  the \nKyoto  Protocol  of  reducing  GHG  emissions  by  20  per  cent  by  2020  compared  with  the \n2005 level. Iceland intends to contribute to the achievement of this target by participating in \nthe EU ETS and by implementing mitigation actions in the non-ETS sectors. The mitigation \naction  plan  that  Iceland  has  put  in  place  aims  to  reduce  national  GHG  emissions,  and  in \nparticular  GHG  emissions  from  non-ETS  sectors,  by  20  per  cent  by  2020  compared  with \nthe  2005  level.  Iceland  has  identified  significant  mitigation  potential  in  afforestation  and \nrevegetation as well as in the transport and fisheries sectors.  \n\n5. \nThe opening presentation  was followed by interventions and questions  from  China \nand India. These questions were on the  PaMs targeted at the reduction of GHG emissions \nfrom  heavy  industry  and  research  on  hydrogen  vehicles.

Ireland  was  represented  by \nMs. Petra  Woods,  Assistant  Principal  Officer,  Climate  Policy  Section,  Department  of  the \nEnvironment, Community and Local Government. \n\n2. \nQuestions for Ireland had been submitted in writing two months before the working \ngroup session by Brazil, China and New Zealand. A list of the questions received and the \nanswers provided by Ireland can be found on the IAR web page for Ireland.1 \n\n3. \nMs.  Woods  made  an  opening  presentation,  summarizing  Ireland’s  progress  in \nimplementation towards the achievement of emission reductions and removals related to its \nquantified economy-wide emission reduction targets.  \n\n4. \nMs. Woods presented Ireland’s target under the Convention as a contribution to the \nquantified  economy-wide  emission  reduction  target  of  the  EU  and  its  member  States  to \nreduce  GHG  emissions  by  20  per  cent  by  2020  compared  with  the  1990  level.  In  this \ncontext, some 27 per cent of Ireland’s GHG emissions are covered and regulated by the EU \nETS, with no specific target for Ireland but with an overall and decreasing cap set at the EU \nlevel to achieve an absolute emission reduction in the covered sectors of 21 per cent relative \nto  the  2005  level  by  2020.  In  addition,  Ireland  has  a  target  for  the  non-ETS  sectors  to \nreduce GHG emissions by 20 per cent relative to the 2005 level.  \n\n5. \nIn  her  presentation,  Ms.  Woods  highlighted  that  Ireland  is  making  progress  in  its \ncontribution to the joint EU emission reduction target, including through the possible use of \nunits  from  market-based  mechanisms  under  the  Convention.  Key  PaMs  put  in  place  to \nachieve  Ireland’s  targets  include:  a  carbon  tax,  in  place  since  2009;  private  car  taxation \nbased  on  CO2  emissions,  in  place  since  2008;  feed-in  tariffs  for  renewable  energy; \nimproved  building  standards;  and  afforestation  and  improved  land  management.  In \naddition,  Ireland  is  focusing  on  agricultural  research  since  the  agriculture  sector  is \nresponsible for about 45 per cent of Ireland’s GHG emissions from the non-ETS sectors. \n\n6. \nThe opening presentation was followed by interventions and questions from  Brazil, \nIndia and New Zealand. The questions were on: the quantification of the effects of Ireland’s \nPaMs; Ireland’s plans to use clean development mechanism (CDM) credits to comply with \nits  targets  and  whether  it  restricts  the  purchase  of  CDM  credits  to  specific  developing \ncountries;  and  Ireland’s  smarter  travel  policy  in  the  context  of  reducing  GHG  emissions \nfrom the transport sector. In response, Ireland provided further explanations.

He  also  explained  how  changes  in  national  circumstances  modified  the  trend  in \nelectricity supply sources, the energy consumption pattern and the GHG emission intensity \nof the economy. \n\n5. \nFurthermore,  Mr.  Mizukoshi  reported  that  Japan  achieved  its  emission  reduction \ntarget for the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol using removals by forests and \nother  carbon  sinks,  as  well  as  units  from  mechanisms  under  the  Kyoto  Protocol.  He  then \npresented  Japan’s  quantified  economy-wide  GHG  emission  reduction  target  for  2020  and \nits underlying assumptions, followed by emission projections by sector and by gas for up to \n2020.  He  explained  the  main  PaMs  on  which  Japan  relies  to  reduce  emissions  (the  Basic \nEnvironment  Law  and  Basic  Environment  Plan,  and  the  Act  on  Promotion  of  Global \nWarming Countermeasures)  and presented the  joint crediting  mechanism that Japan plans \nto use to achieve its 2020 target. \n\nthe  Kyoto  Protocol;  civil-society  actions,  a \n\n6. \nThe  opening  presentation  was  followed  by  interventions  and  questions  from \nAustralia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Fiji, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, Saudi \nArabia, the United Kingdom and the United States. The questions were on: Japan’s revision \nof its 2020 target (3.8 per cent below  the 2005 emission level) and how Japan will ensure \nthat the target will not be weakened; Japan’s participation in the second commitment period \nof \nlow-carbon  society  and  regional \ndevelopment;  Japan’s  plans  for  the  future  use  of  its  nuclear  energy  production  capacity; \nJapan’s strategy for reducing emissions from shipping; the estimated quantitative mitigation \neffects of Japan’s PaMs and the PaMs that are expected to contribute the most to reducing \nemissions; and the joint crediting mechanism (the rationale behind it, how credits would be \nshared  among  Parties,  and  the  independent  nature  of  the  verification  of,  and  accounting \nrules for, the mechanism).

She  outlined \n\n3. \nMs.  Summer  made  an  opening  presentation,  summarizing  Liechtenstein’s  progress \nin  the  implementation  of  its  emission  reduction  and  removal  commitments  related  to  its \nthe  national \nreduction \nquantified  economy-wide  emission \ncircumstances of Liechtenstein, which is a very small country with small and medium-sized \nenterprises  and  an  export-oriented  economy.  She  explained  that,  although  its  impact  on \nglobal  emissions  is  insignificant,  Liechtenstein  takes  its  commitments  regarding  climate \nchange seriously. Liechtenstein’s economy-wide emission reduction target corresponds to a \n20  per  cent  emission  reduction  by  2020  compared  with  the  1990  level.  Although \nLiechtenstein experienced significant economic and population growth, by 230 and 25 per \ncent, respectively, between 1990 and 2012, the emission level in 2012 was slightly below \nthe level in 1990. \n\n4. \nGiven  that  Lichtenstein’s  energy  sector  contributed  84  per  cent  of  its  total  GHG \nemissions  in  2012,  Liechtenstein’s  PaMs  are  targeted  mainly  at  that  sector.  The  most \nimportant  supporting  legislation  includes:  the  Emissions  Trading  Act,  which  stipulates \nLiechtenstein’s  participation  in  the  EU  ETS;  the  Energy  Efficiency  Act,  which  regulates \nfinancial support for energy efficiency measures and measures to increase the share of RES; \nand the Carbon Dioxide Act. A new version of the National Climate Strategy is expected by \nthe end of 2015. In addition, Liechtenstein has been investing in photovoltaic installations \nsince 2008, resulting in an installed capacity increase from 1,170 MWh in 2009 to 15,550 \nMWh  in  2014.  Other  measures  that  are  specific  to  the  national  circumstances  of \nLiechtenstein  include  the  commissioning  of  a  wood-fired  power  station  and  a  steam \npipeline  from  a  waste  incineration  plant  in  neighbouring  Switzerland.  Regarding  forests, \nMs. Summer explained that wooded area comprises 41 per cent of Liechtenstein’s total area \nand that most of the forest is protected forest with provisions that prohibit deforestation.  \n\n5. \nThe opening presentation was followed by interventions and questions from  Brazil, \nChina, the Netherlands and New Zealand. The questions related to: Liechtenstein’s plans to \nuse  units  from  market-based  mechanisms  to  achieve  its  emission  reduction  targets; \nadditional measures planned to achieve its targets; the relationship between its target under \nthe Convention and that under the Kyoto Protocol; the implementation status and expected \neffect  of  its  infrastructure  measures  relating  to  railways;  and  the  contribution  of \nLiechtenstein’s  mitigation  actions  to  the  observed  trend  in  the  emission  intensity  of  its \neconomy. In response, Liechtenstein provided further explanations.

Lithuania was represented by \n\n1. \nMs. Stasile Znutiene, Ministry of Environment. \n\n2. \nQuestions  for  Lithuania  had  been  submitted  in  writing  two  months  before  the \nworking group session by China. A list of the questions received and the answers provided \nby Lithuania can be found on the IAR web page for Lithuania.1 \n\n3. \nMs.  Znutiene  made  an  opening  presentation,  summarizing  Lithuania’s  progress  in \nimplementation towards the achievement of emission reductions and removals related to its \nquantified  economy-wide  emission  reduction  targets.  GHG  emissions  excluding  the \nLULUCF sector in Lithuania in 2012 showed a decrease of 55.6 per cent compared with the \n1990  level,  while  GDP  increased  by  25  per  cent  over  the  same  period,  indicating  a \ndecoupling  of  GHG  emissions  from  economic  growth.  According  to  Ms.  Znutiene, \nLithuania overachieved its emission reduction target for the first commitment period of the \nKyoto Protocol.  \n\n4. \nMs.  Znutiene presented  Lithuania’s 2020 targets at a disaggregated level, covering \nits  targets  under  the  EU  ETS  and  for  sectors  outside  the  EU  ETS,  as  well  as  targets  for \nrenewable energy, biofuels in transport and improvements in energy efficiency. According \nto historical data  and current  GHG  emission projections, Lithuania is on track to  meet its \ntargets.  By  2012  energy  consumption  in  Lithuania  had  reduced  by  almost  5 per  cent \ncompared  with  the  2009  level,  while  nearly  21.7  per  cent  of  the  total  energy  consumed \ncame  from  RES,  against  the  target  of  23 per  cent  by  2020.  For  the  non-ETS  sectors, \nLithuania is on track to meet its 2020 target with the use of additional measures. Key PaMs \nare  in  place  to  ensure  the  achievement  of  Lithuania’s  2020  targets,  including  the \noverarching  National  Strategy  for  Climate  Change  Management  Policy  for  the  period \n2013–2050, the  Action Plan to operationalize the Strategy  for the period 2013–2020, and \nsector-specific  PaMs,  as  well  as  related  economic  instruments  and  financial  support \nmechanisms.  \n\n5. \nThe opening presentation was followed by interventions and questions from Brazil, \nChina, India and  the Republic of Korea. The questions were on: Lithuania’s further plans \nand policies to reduce emissions from the transport and agriculture sectors; the key drivers \nfor the 56 per cent decrease in GHG emissions by 2012 compared with the 1990 level; the \nmain reasons  for the sharp decrease in GHG emissions during the  period 1990–1992; the \ncoverage  of  tariff  subsidies  as  an  economic  instrument;  and  the  development  of  RES, \nincluding the institutional mechanism in place and specific policies on biofuel. In response, \nLithuania provided further explanations.

Malta  was  represented  by  Ms. \n1. \nSimone Borg, Ambassador of the Ministry for Sustainable Development, the Environment \nand Climate Change, and Ms. Claire Qoul from the same ministry. \n\n2. \nQuestions for Malta had been submitted in  writing two months before the  working \ngroup  session  by  Brazil  and  China.  A  list  of  the  questions  received  and  the  answers \nprovided by Malta can be found on the IAR web page for Malta.1  \n\n3. \nMs.  Borg  made  an  opening  presentation,  summarizing  Malta’s  progress  in \nimplementation towards the achievement of emission reductions and removals related to its \nquantified  economy-wide  emission  reduction  targets.  She  elaborated  on  the  national \ncircumstances of Malta, which are key to explaining the emission profile of Malta and the \ncountry’s  limited  potential  in  the  development  of  RES.  The  GHG  emission  intensity \ndecreased  by  56  per  cent  in  2012  compared  with  the  1990  level,  while  national  GDP  per \ncapita increased by 260 per cent, indicating a decoupling of GHG emissions from economic \ngrowth in Malta. \n\n4. \nMs.  Qoul  presented  Malta’s  target  for  2020  in  the  context  of  the  EU  climate  and \nenergy package, with an emphasis on Malta’s emission reduction target for sectors outside \nthe EU ETS. As a member State of the EU, Malta has a target under the ESD to limit the \ngrowth of its emissions in the non-ETS sectors by 5 per cent by 2020 compared  with the \n2005  level.  Despite  the  limited  mitigation  potential  in  Malta,  the  existing  PaMs  in  the \ntransport, agriculture and waste sectors are projected to produce mitigation effects that will \nkeep Malta on track to meet its 2020 target for sectors outside the EU ETS. In addition, Ms. \nQoul  elaborated  on  the  Party’s  PaMs  in  electricity  generation,  which  will  make  a  major \ncontribution to the overall GHG emission reduction in Malta in the lead-up to 2030. \n\nThe opening presentation was followed by interventions and questions from Algeria, \n5. \nBotswana and China. These questions were on the limited potential for the development of \nlarge-scale and centralized RES and of distributed RES, and the drivers of the decrease in \nGHG emissions during 2015–2016. A point was also raised on Malta’s financial support for \nthe  efforts  of  developing  countries  to  tackle  climate  change.  In  response,  Malta  provided \nfurther  explanations.  Details  can  be  found  in  the  webcast  of  this  session  on  the  IAR  web \npage for Malta. \n\n1  <http://unfccc.int/8827.php>. \n\n46 \n\n \n \n \n                                                           \n \n\x0cFCCC/SBI/2015/10 \n\nSummary report on multilateral assessment of Monaco \n\nThe  first  MA  of  Monaco  took  place  on  5 June  2015.  Monaco  was  represented  by \n\n1. \nMr. Patrick Rolland, Department of the Environment. \n\n2. \nQuestions for Monaco had been submitted in writing two months before the working \ngroup session by Brazil, China, the EU and the Netherlands. A list of the questions received \nand the answers provided by Monaco can be found on the IAR web page for Monaco.2  \n\n3. \nMr. Rolland made an opening presentation, summarizing Monaco’s progress in the \nimplementation of its emission reduction and removal commitments related to its quantified \neconomy-wide  emission  reduction  targets.  He  explained  the  national  circumstances  of \nMonaco,  which is a very  small country and a net importer of energy. Energy is the  main \nsource  of  GHG  emissions  in  Monaco,  contributing  more  than  90  per  cent  of  its  total \nemissions and originating in equal shares from waste incineration, buildings and transport. \nSince 2000 a gradual decrease in emissions has been observed, which led to emissions in \n2012 being 13 per cent lower than the base year level, compared with its target of an 8 per \ncent emission reduction for the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. The  main \nPaMs contributing to the emission decrease include: a cap on the annual waste capacity of \nthe  waste  incineration  plant;  urban  renewal;  the  banning  of  domestic  fuel  boilers  in  new \nbuildings; and the clean mobility policy. \n\n4. \nRegarding  its  mitigation  targets  under  the  Convention,  Monaco  is  committed  to \nreducing its emissions by 30 per cent by 2020 and by 80 per cent by 2050 compared with \nthe 1990 level, and to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. LULUCF is not accounted for \nas  it  comprises  only  0.04  per  cent  of  Monaco’s  total  annual  emissions.  In  addition  to  its \nclimate  commitments,  Monaco  is  also  committed  to  increasing  energy  efficiency  in \nbuildings  by  20  per  cent,  to  achieving  a  20  per  cent  share  of  RES  in  its  final  energy \nproduction and to keeping electricity consumption stable by 2020. To achieve those targets, \nMonaco implemented its Energy and Climate Action Plan. According to its GHG emission \nprojections,  meeting  its  targets  by  2020  will  not  be  ensured  by  domestic  emission \nreductions alone. Hence, Monaco is currently defining and implementing additional PaMs \nto achieve its 2020 and longer-term targets, including: the prevention of waste production \nand  the  renewal  of  the  waste  treatment  facility;  the  promotion  of  clean  vehicles,  soft \nmobility  and  infrastructure  for  intra-urban  logistics;  and,  in  buildings,  the  gradual \nsubstitution of fossil fuels for renewable energy along with energy efficiency measures.  \n\n5. \nThe opening presentation was followed by interventions and questions from Brazil, \nChina,  India,  New  Zealand,  the  Republic  of  Korea  and  the  United  Republic  of  Tanzania. \nThe  questions  related  to:  PaMs  to  reduce  emissions  from  transport;  PaMs  to  increase  the \nshare  of  biofuels;  subsidies  for  domestic  households;  measures  to  reduce  electricity \nconsumption,  also  targeting  the  import  of  electricity;  emission  trends  in  the  most  recent \nyears; Monaco’s participation in activities related to reducing emissions from international \naviation; and how emission reduction efforts in Monaco are influenced by its dependency \non  international  and  cross-border  cooperation.  In  response,  Monaco  provided  further \nexplanations.

Norway was represented by Mr. \n\n1. \nPeer Stiansen, Senior Adviser, Ministry of Climate and Environment. \n\n2. \nQuestions for Norway had been submitted in writing two months before the working \ngroup session by Brazil, Canada, China, the EU, New Zealand, Switzerland and the United \nStates. A list of the questions received and the answers provided by Norway can be found \non the IAR web page for Norway.1  \n\n3. \nMr.  Stiansen  made  an  opening  presentation,  summarizing  Norway’s  progress  in \nimplementation towards the achievement of emission reductions and removals related to its \nquantified economy-wide emission reduction targets. \n\n4. \nUnder  the  Convention,  Norway  made  a  commitment  to  reduce  its  GHG  emissions \nby  30  per  cent  by  2020  compared  with  the  1990  level.  This  target  will  be  reached  by \nNorway through its commitment for the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, \nwith average annual emissions over the period 2013–2020 projected to be at 84 per cent of \nthe  1990  level.  Mr.  Stiansen  highlighted  Norway’s  long-term  objective  to  become  a  low-\nemission  society  and  reach  carbon  neutrality  by  2050  (2030  if  part  of  an  ambitious  new \nglobal climate agreement).  \n\n5. \nIn  his  presentation  Mr.  Stiansen  outlined  that  Norway  is  on  track  to  achieve  its \nemission  reduction  target  under  the  Convention.  Achieving  it  will  require  enhanced \ndomestic  efforts  as  well  as  the  use  of  units  from  market-based  mechanisms  under  the \nConvention,  both  by  purchasing  assigned  amount  units  and  certified  emission \nreductions/emission  reduction  units  through  the  EU  ETS  and  by  purchasing  CDM  credits \nthrough the Norwegian purchase programme.  \n\n6.  With  regard  to  Norway’s  key  domestic  PaMs,  Mr.  Stiansen  stated  that  Norway  is \nbuilding its climate change policy based on a comprehensive set of PaMs, with some 80 per \ncent of its emissions being already subject to fiscal and economic instruments (carbon taxes \nand/or emissions trading). Most notable in the Norwegian policy mix are  CO2 taxes in the \ntransport \ntaxes  on \nhydrofluorocarbons/perfluorocarbons, and the EU ETS, which covers more than 50 per cent \nof Norway’s domestic emissions. In addition, Mr. Stiansen emphasized the importance of \nadvancing CO2 capture and storage technologies for achieving Norway’s long-term goal of \nreaching carbon neutrality.  \n\nthe  offshore  petroleum \n\nequivalent \n\nsector, \n\nsector \n\nand \n\nThe opening presentation was followed by interventions and questions from Brazil, \n7. \nChina,  the  EU,  Fiji,  India,  Japan,  New  Zealand,  the  Republic  of  Korea,  Samoa,  South \nAfrica, Switzerland and the United States. These questions were related to: success factors \nand the quantification of the effects of PaMs in Norway, in particular relating to fiscal and \neconomic  instruments;  the  application  of  renewable  energies  in  the  energy  mix  in  the \nenergy  and  transport  sectors;  the  Norwegian  purchase  programme  for  CDM  credits,  its \nvolume  and  its  purchase  criteria;  and  emissions  and  removals  from  the  land  sector.  In \nresponse, Norway provided further explanations.

Poland  was  represented  by \n\n1. \nMs. Sylwia Waśniewska, Institute of Environmental Protection. \n\n2. \nQuestions for Poland had been submitted in writing two months before the working \ngroup session by Brazil, China, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland and  the United States. A list of \nthe questions received and the answers provided by Poland can be found on the IAR web \npage for Poland.1 \n\n3. \nMs. Waśniewska  made an opening presentation, summarizing Poland’s progress in \nthe  implementation  of  its  emission  reduction  and  removal  commitments  related  to  its \nquantified  economy-wide  emission  reduction  targets.  GHG  emissions  in  Poland  had \ndecreased  by  29  per  cent  by  2012  compared  with  the  base  year  level.  Thus,  Poland’s \nemissions are well below its target for the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, \nwhich  corresponds  to  an  emission  reduction  of  6  per  cent  compared  with  the  base  year \nlevel.  While  emissions  decreased,  GDP  increased  significantly  over  the  same  period, \nsignalling  a  decoupling  of  GDP  from  emission  growth,  owing  to  economic  and \ntechnological changes and a  significant drop in the  emission intensity of Poland’s energy \nuse. Poland is committed to contributing to the target of the EU under the Convention and \nits Kyoto Protocol of a 20 per cent reduction in emissions by 2020 compared with the 1990 \nlevel. In accordance with the ESD, Poland has a target to limit the growth in its emissions \nfrom the non-ETS sectors to 14 per cent by 2020 compared  with the 2005 level (+14 per \ncent).  In  addition,  Ms. Waśniewska  explained  Poland’s  targets  regarding  the  share  of \nrenewables  in  its  final  energy  consumption,  the  share  of  biofuels  in  transport  fuel,  and \nenergy efficiency. \n\n4. \nAccording to its GHG emission projections, Poland expects emission levels that are \n32  per  cent  lower  in  2020  and  36  per  cent  lower  in  2030  than  the  base  year  level,  with \nemissions from energy and agriculture expected to decrease the most. Also, emissions from \nthe  non-ETS  sectors  are  expected  to  stay  well  below  the  target  trajectory,  reflecting  the \ntarget under the ESD for 2020. Thus, Poland expects to meet its emission reduction targets \nwith  domestic  measures  only.  Ms. Waśniewska  presented  the  key  elements  of  the  Polish \nclimate  policy,  including  its  main  strategies,  the  Energy  Policy  of  Poland  until  2030,  the \nRenewable  Energy  Sources  Act  and  the  National  Energy  Efficiency  Action  Plan.  In \naddition, she explained that the energy policy is currently being updated. It will be extended \nto 2050 and will be published in 2016. She further explained that the National Programme \nfor  the  Development  of  a  Low-Emission  Economy,  which  aims  to  identify  key  areas  for \nemission reductions, will be published in 2015. \n\n5. \nThe  opening  presentation  was  followed  by  interventions  and  questions  from \nAustralia,  Brazil,  China,  the  Republic  of  Korea,  Saudi  Arabia  and  the  United  States. \nQuestions were raised regarding: the envisaged shares of different energy sources including \nnuclear  energy  in  Poland’s  final  energy  consumption  by  2020  and  2030  according  to  the \nnew  energy  policy;  whether  some  of  the  PaMs  included  in  the  new  energy  policy  are \nexpected  to  show  a  mitigation  effect  before  2020;  the  effect  of  Poland’s  PaMs;  specific \nPaMs  targeting  emissions  from  coal  use;  the  economic  feasibility  of  CO2  capture  and \nstorage  in  Poland;  PaMs  in  the  non-ETS  sectors;  and  Poland’s  use  of  units  from  market-\nbased mechanisms to achieve its targets. Questions were also raised in relation to Poland’s \nassessment of the social and economic consequences of its response measures. In response, \n\n1  <http://unfccc.int/8830.php>. \n\n49 \n\n \n                                                           \n \n\x0cFCCC/SBI/2015/10 \n\nPoland provided further explanations.

A  list  of  the  questions  received  and  the \nanswers provided by Romania can be found on the IAR web page for Romania.1  \n\n3. \nMs. Boldea made an opening presentation, summarizing Romania’s  progress in the \nimplementation of its emission reduction and removal commitments related to its quantified \neconomy-wide emission reduction targets. Under the Convention, Romania  participates in \nthe EU joint economy-wide emission reduction target to achieve a 20 per cent reduction in \nemissions by 2020 compared with the 1990 (base year) level. The target for the EU and its \nmember States is formalized in the EU climate and energy package, which includes the EU \nETS and the ESD. Under the ESD, Romania has a target of limiting emission growth to 19 \nper cent above the 2005 level by 2020 (+19 per cent) from sectors covered by the ESD. In \nline  with  the  EU  approach  to  its  target,  Romania  does  not  include  emissions  or  removals \nfrom  the  LULUCF  sector  in  defining  its  quantified  economy-wide  target.  The  ESD  also \nincludes binding renewable energy goals and non-binding energy efficiency goals for each \nmember State. For Romania, it specifies a binding renewable energy goal of a 24 per cent \nrenewable  energy  share  in  its  gross  total  final  energy  consumption.  Regarding  energy \nefficiency,  Romania  has  a  non-binding  goal  to  achieve  30.32  Mtoe  of  primary  energy \nconsumption by 2020.  \n\n4. \nThe  key  policy  framework  related  to  climate  change  in  Romania  is  the  National \nStrategy  for  Climate  Change  2013–2020,  which  addresses  the  achievement  of  Romania’s \nnational objectives and greenhouse gas emission targets for 2020, as well as the adaptation \nmeasures needed to allow society and ecosystems to adapt to climate change. Specifically, \nthe National Strategy takes into account relevant EU policies, such as the EU climate and \nenergy  package  referred  to  in  paragraph  5  above.  Romania’s  total  GHG  emissions \nexcluding emissions and removals from LULUCF decreased by 49.5 per cent between 1990 \nand 2011, with projections showing an emission increase up to 2020. Across the EU, it is \nexpected  that  the  market  mechanism  of  the  EU  ETS  will  guarantee  that  emissions  from \nsectors under this scheme (mainly large point sources such as power plants and industrial \nfacilities) will achieve the 2020 target of 21 per cent below the 2005 level. Under the ESD, \nRomania is expected to meet its emission reduction target as well as its renewable energy \nand energy efficiency goals.  \n\n5. \nThe opening presentation  was followed by interventions and questions  from  China \nand  the  Republic  of  Korea.  The  questions  were  related  to  the  drivers  of  Romania’s \nprojected increase in GHG emissions and the impact of the EU ETS, energy efficiency and \nrenewable  energy  deployment  on  emission  reductions.  In  response,  Romania  provided \nfurther  explanations.  Details  can  be  found  in  the  webcast  of  this  session  on  the  IAR  web \npage for Romania. \n\n1  <http://unfccc.int/8831.php>. \n\n51 \n\n \n                                                           \n \n\x0cFCCC/SBI/2015/10 \n\nSummary report on multilateral assessment of the Russian Federation \n\n1. \nThe  first  MA  of  the  Russian  Federation  took  place  on  5  June  2015.  The  Russian \nFederation  was  represented  by  Ms.  Dinara  Gershinkova,  Deputy  Head  of  Special  and \nScientific  Programmes,  Federal  Service  for  Hydrometeorology  and  Environmental \nMonitoring \n\nQuestions  for  the  Russian  Federation  had  been  submitted  in  writing  two  months \n2. \nbefore  the  working  group  session  by  Brazil,  China,  the  EU,  New Zealand,  Saudi  Arabia, \nSweden, Switzerland and the United States. A list of the questions received and the answers \nprovided  by  the  Russian  Federation  can  be  found  on  the  IAR  web  page  for  the  Russian \nFederation.1  \n\nto \n\nits  quantified  economy-wide  emission  reduction \n\nMs.  Gershinkova  made  an  opening  presentation,  summarizing \n\n3. \nthe  Russian \nFederation’s  progress  towards  the  achievement  of  its  emission  limitation  and  reduction \ncommitment  related \ntargets. \nMs. Gershinkova  initially  referred  to  the  questions  received  prior  to  the  working  group \nsession  and  the  answers  provided.  She  then  described  how  the  target  for  the  first \ncommitment  period  of  the  Kyoto  Protocol  has  been  overachieved  by  a  large  margin,  in \nparticular  owing  to  the  adoption  of  legislation  for  energy  efficiency  improvement  and \nrenewable energy development and the results delivered by these policies. Ms. Gershinkova \nemphasized  the  observed  decoupling  of  emission  growth  from  economic  growth  in  the \ncountry since 2000, which is also a result of increased energy efficiency and the structural \neconomic changes that occurred in the Russian Federation. \n\nMs. Gershinkova also provided details of the Russian Federation’s target under the \n4. \nConvention,  which  corresponds  to  the  limitation  of  emissions  to  a  level  of  no  more  than \n75.0 per  cent  of  the  1990  level  by  2020.  She  described  the  action  plan  for  2014–2017 \nadopted  by  the  Government  containing  economy-wide  measures  that  support  the \nachievement  of  this  target,  such  as  State  regulations  on  GHG  emissions  in  various \neconomic  sectors,  including  carbon  market  mechanisms,  and  indicated  that  the  LULUCF \nsector is not included in the target. She further elaborated on PaMs in the LULUCF sector, \nhighlighting the importance of this sector and its contribution to addressing climate change \nin  the  Russian  Federation,  and  the  implementation  of  a  wide  range  of  measures  for  the \nsector for the period 2013–2020.  \n\n5. \nMs.  Gershinkova  indicated  that  the  Russian  Federation  is  on  track  to  achieve  its \ntarget under the Convention, which is supported by different emission projection scenarios \ndeveloped  by  independent  groups.  In  the  “with  additional  measures”  scenario,  which \ninvolves measures such as CO2 capture and storage, the Russian Federation would achieve \na level of GHG emissions corresponding to 66.9 per cent of the 1990 level, which is below \nthe  75.0  per  cent  specified  in  the  target.  She  also  mentioned  that  in  different  emissions \nscenarios  for  the  period  2010–2050,  the  net  CO2  removals  by  forests  in  the  Russian \nFederation  decrease  gradually.  Finally,  Ms.  Gershinkova  referred  to  the  Russian \nFederation’s  submission  on  31 March  2015  of  its  intended  nationally  determined \ncontribution, which aims to allow the country to move forward on the path of low-carbon \ndevelopment compatible with the long-term objective of the Convention to stay below the 2 \n°C increase in the global average temperature. \n\n6. \nThe  opening  presentation  was  followed  by  interventions  and  questions  from \nAustralia,  Brazil,  China,  the  EU,  Germany,  India,  New  Zealand,  the  Republic  of  Korea, \nSaudi Arabia and South Africa. These questions were on: the actions taken to reverse the \n\n1  <http://unfccc.int/8832.php>. \n\n52 \n\n                                                           \n \n\x0cFCCC/SBI/2015/10 \n\ntrend of growing emissions in recent years;  the list of quantitative details of the measures \nwith  the  greatest  mitigation  potential;  quantitative  estimates  of  mitigation  effects  of \ndomestic PaMs and the intended use of Kyoto Protocol units in achieving the 2020 target; \nthe drivers for the increase in net removals in the LULUCF sector since 1994 and relevant \nactions;  the  information  on  the  action  plan  2014–2017  and  its  key  measures  to  meet  the \n2020  target.  Further  questions  were  on:  the  PaM  put  in  place  to  achieve  the  target  of \nreducing  the  energy  intensity  of  the  economy  by  12  per  cent  by  2020  compared  with  the \n2007; the programmes implemented and the specific consideration of new technologies in \nthe Russian Federation to increase the share of renewable energy in road transportation by \nup to 35 per cent by 2030 and the share of renewable energy in electricity production by up \nto  4.5  per  cent  by  2020;  the  differences  in  the  role  of  local  governments  and  the  central \ngovernment  in  the  reduction  of  GHG  emissions;  the  contribution  of  energy  efficiency \nimprovements as the  major driver to the  total emission reductions in  the country; and the \nroad map or time schedule for applying additional carbon pricing policies or measures, such \nas  carbon  markets  and  carbon  taxation,  and  whether  these  will  be  implemented  before  or \nafter 2020.  \n\n7. \nThere  were  specific  questions  on  reporting,  such  as  the  limited  reporting  on  the \nassessment  of  the  mitigation  impact  of  the  key  PaMs  and  their  aggregated  effect  in  the \nbiennial report. Questions were also raised in relation to the Party’s assessment of the social \nand  economic  consequences  of  response  measures.  In  response,  the  Russian  Federation \nprovided  further  explanations.  Details  can  be  found  in  the  webcast  of  this  session  on  the \nIAR web page for the Russian Federation. \n\n53 \n\n \n \n \n\x0cFCCC/SBI/2015/10 \n\nSummary report on multilateral assessment of Slovakia \n\nThe  first  MA  of  Slovakia  took  on  5 June  2015.  Slovakia  was  represented  by \n\n1. \nMs. Helena Princova from the Ministry of the Environment. \n\n2. \nQuestions  for  Slovakia  had  been  submitted  in  writing  two  months  before  the \nworking  group  session  by  Brazil  and  China.  A  list  of  the  questions  received  and  the \nanswers provided by Slovakia can be found on the IAR web page for Slovakia.1  \n\n3. \nMs.  Princova  made  an  opening  presentation,  summarizing  Slovakia’s  progress  in \nimplementation of its emission reduction and removal commitments related to its quantified \neconomy-wide emission reduction targets. She elaborated on the national circumstances of \nSlovakia,  which  is  a  small  landlocked  country  and  a  member  State  of  the  EU.  She \nexplained that Slovakia’s target for the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol was \noverachieved, with emissions 41.7 per cent lower in 2012 than in 1990. This was achieved \nmainly through stricter legislation, by introducing best available technologies and by fuel-\nswitching from coal and oil to natural gas. Altogether, this led to a decoupling of economic \ngrowth  from  the  level  of  GHG  emissions  in  the  period  1990–2012,  during  which  the \nemission  intensity  of  Slovakia’s  gross  domestic  product  decreased  by  68  per  cent.  This \ntrend  continued  during  the  economic  crisis  in  the  late  2000s,  with  emission  intensity \ndecreasing  by  36 per  cent  between  2005  and  2012.  In  2012,  energy  remained  the  most \nsignificant sector in terms of  GHG  emissions,  with a share of  69.6 per cent of  Slovakia’s \ntotal emissions, and within that sector emissions from transport showed the largest increase. \n\n4. \nSlovakia is committed to contributing to the target of the EU under the Convention \nand its Kyoto Protocol of a 20 per cent reduction in emissions by 2020 compared with the \n1990  levels.  In  accordance  with  the  ESD,  Slovakia  has  a  target  to  limit  the  growth  in  its \nemissions from the non-ETS sectors to 13 per cent by 2020 compared with the 2005 level \n(+13 per cent). The PaMs in place to achieve that target focus on improvements in energy \nefficiency  and  the  increase  of  the  share  of  renewables.  The  PaMs  include:  the  National \nReform Programme and its  Action Plan,  with targeted sectoral policies, including climate \nand  energy  policies;  the  National  Environmental  Strategy;  the  Energy  Security  Strategy; \ntaxation  of  energy  products  and  electricity;  the  Action  Plan  for  Energy  Efficiency;  the \nNational  Action  Plan  for  Biomass  Use;  the  National  Renewable  Energy  Action  Plan;  the \nConcept  of  Energy  Efficiency  in  Buildings;  the  Waste  Act;  and  the  implementation  of \nseveral  EU-wide  measures.  According  to  Slovakia’s  GHG  emission  projections,  total \nemissions, taking into account implemented and adopted PaMs, are expected to decrease by \n12.1 per cent by 2020 compared with the 2005 level. Thus, Slovakia considers that it is on \nits  way  to  achieving  its  2020  target  for  emissions  from  the  non-ETS  sectors.  In  addition, \nMs.  Princova  explained  that  the  EU  and  its  member  States  are  committed  to  a  binding \ntarget of a reduction in domestic GHG emissions of at least 40 per cent by 2030 compared \nwith the 1990 level. \n\n5. \nThe opening presentation  was followed by interventions and questions  from  China \nand  the  Republic  of  Korea.  The  questions  were  related  to  Slovakia’s  renewable  energy \ntarget, PaMs in place to reduce emissions from international aviation and shipping, and the \ntarget  for  the  sectors  covered  by  the  EU  ETS.  In  response,  Slovakia  provided  further \nexplanations. Details can be found in the webcast of this session on the IAR web page for \nSlovakia. \n\n1  <http://unfccc.int/8833.php>. \n\n54 \n\n \n                                                           \n \n\x0cFCCC/SBI/2015/10 \n\nSummary report on multilateral assessment of Slovenia \n\nThe  first MA of Slovenia took place on 5 June 2015.  Slovenia  was represented by \n\n1. \nMr. Uros Vajgl from the Ministry of Agriculture and the Environment. \n\n2. \nQuestions  for  Slovenia  had  been  submitted  in  writing  two  months  before  the \nworking  group  session  by  Brazil  and  China.  A  list  of  the  questions  received  and  the \nanswers provided by Slovenia can be found on the IAR web page for Slovenia.1  \n\n3. \nMr.  Vajgl  made  an  opening  presentation,  summarizing  Slovenia’s  progress  in  the \nimplementation  of  emission  reduction  and  removal  commitments  related  to  its  quantified \neconomy-wide emission reduction targets. He elaborated on the national circumstances of \nSlovenia,  which  is  a  small  country  and  a  member  State  of  the  EU.  Slovenia  already \nexperienced  warming  of  1.7  °C  between  1961  and  2011  and,  according  to  climate \nscenarios, expects significant climate change impacts by 2050, including a further increase \nin  temperature  and  an  increased  occurrence  of  extreme  weather  events  like  floods. \nMr. Vajgl explained that Slovenia achieved its target for the first commitment period of the \nKyoto  Protocol,  an  emission  reduction  of  8  per  cent  compared  with  the  1986  (base  year) \nlevel, owing partly to a decoupling of economic growth from the level of GHG emissions in \nthe  period  1990–2012,  during  which  the  emission  intensity  of  Slovenia’s  gross  domestic \nproduct fell by 40 per cent. He further explained that the biggest emission reductions were \nachieved  in  industry  and  transport  and  that  the  economic  crisis  also  contributed  to  those \nreductions.  \n\n4. \nSlovenia is committed to contributing to the target of the EU under the Convention \nand its Kyoto Protocol of a reduction in emissions of 20 per cent by 2020 compared with \nthe 1990 level. In accordance with the ESD, Slovenia has a target to limit the growth in its \nemissions  from the  non-ETS sectors to 5 per cent by 2020 compared  with the  2005 level \n(+5  per  cent).  According  to  its  GHG  emission  projections,  emissions  from  the  non-ETS \nsectors, including the effect of implemented and adopted PaMs, are expected to be close to \nthe trajectory of Slovenia’s target under the ESD. Mr. Vajgl explained that one of the main \nchallenges  regarding  future  emission  reductions  is  the  transport  sector,  which  contributes \n30  per  cent  of  Slovenia’s  total  emissions  and  is  the  sector  where  half  of  the  emission \nreductions  required  for  the  non-ETS  sectors  needs  to  happen.  Such  challenges  relate  to \nSlovenia being a transit country with dispersed settlements and daily migration flows. Mr. \nVajgl  also  explained  that  additional  PaMs  will  be  needed  for  Slovenia  to  meet  its  target \nunder  the  ESD;  to  this  end,  in  2014  Slovenia  adopted  the  Operational  Programme  for \nReducing GHG Emissions until 2020 with a View to 2030. The programme covers the non-\nETS  sectors,  sets  indicative  sectoral  targets  and  includes  a  list  of  measures  to  be \nimplemented.  Mr.  Vajgl  emphasized  that  the  programme  includes  a  target  trajectory  that \n‘overshoots’ the target for 2020, which is necessary because of uncertainties in the transport \nsector and the need to facilitate the achievement of the 2030 target.  \n\n5. \nThe opening presentation was followed by interventions and questions from Brazil, \nChina and India. The questions related to PaMs encouraging the use of RES and any related \nsupport  schemes,  and  specific  PaMs  to  deal  with  emissions  from  transit  in  the  transport \nsector.  In  response,  Slovenia  provided  further  explanations.  Details  can  be  found  in  the \nwebcast of this session on the IAR web page for Slovenia. \n\n1  <http://unfccc.int/8834.php>. \n\n55 \n\n \n                                                           \n \n\x0cFCCC/SBI/2015/10 \n\nSummary report on multilateral assessment of Ukraine \n\n1. \nThe first MA of Ukraine took place on 5 June 2015. Ukraine was represented by Ms. \nElena Balbekova, Deputy Director of the Climate Policy Department, Ministry of Ecology \nand Natural Resources. \n\n2. \nQuestions for Ukraine had been submitted in writing two months before the working \ngroup session by Brazil, China, the EU and Sweden. A list of the questions received and the \nanswers provided by Ukraine can be found on the IAR web page for Ukraine.1  \n\n3. \nMs.  Balbekova  made  an  opening  presentation,  summarizing  Ukraine’s  progress \ntowards the achievement of its emission limitation and reduction commitment related to its \nquantified economy-wide emission reduction targets. Ms. Balbekova initially described the \nnew  institutional  arrangements  related  to  climate  change  in  the  country,  including  the \nnational inventory system of Ukraine. She explained the GHG emission trends since 1990 \nand  highlighted  the  importance  of  the  energy  sector’s  contribution  to  the  national \nemissions, which has driven the observed trend of reduction in these emissions. \n\n4. \nReferring  to  Ukraine’s  target  under  the  Convention,  Ms.  Balbekova  provided \ninformation  on  Ukraine’s  emission  limitation  commitment  for  participating  in  the  second \ncommitment period of the Kyoto Protocol to an emission level 24 per cent below the 1990 \nlevel by 2020. She described the policy framework and cross-sectoral measures for climate \nchange  inscribed  in  Ukraine’s  new  strategy  for  sustainable  development  and  the  national \naction plan on the implementation of the association agreement with the European Union, \nhighlighting  measures  in  the  energy,  industry  and  forestry  sectors,  and  provided \ninformation  on  the  impacts  of  the  key  mitigation  actions.  Ms. Balbekova  provided \ninformation on the key assumptions on GDP and fuel consumption used in the three GHG \nemission projection scenarios presented in Ukraine’s sixth national communication and first \nbiennial  report  and  the  results  of  these  scenarios  in  terms  of  GHG  emissions  by  sector. \nFinally, Ms. Balbekova provided a summary of the questions received prior to the working \ngroup session and the answers provided.  \n\n5. \nThe  opening  presentation  was  followed  by  interventions  and  questions  from \nAustralia, Brazil, China and the Republic of Korea. These questions were on: the tax code \npolicy with regard to reductions in land tax and income tax for renewable energy businesses \nand  the  renewable  energy  action  plan  and  whether  they  were  related  or  separate  policies; \nthe plans to assess the economic feasibility of potentially increasing the level of ambition \nvis-à-vis development needs; the reasons for the many changes in the removal trends in the \nLULUCF  sector;  the  economic  and  ecological  appropriateness  of  the  development  of \nrenewable energy; the possible additional  measures to address climate change issues; and \nthe  assessment  of  how  much  of  the  economic  growth  will  be  sacrificed  in  the  “with \nmeasures” and “with additional measures” emission scenarios compared with the baseline \nscenario  or  the  “without  measures”  scenario.  In  response,  Ukraine  provided  further \nexplanations.

The United Kingdom was represented by Mr. Ben Lyon, Department \nof Energy & Climate Change. \n\nQuestions for the United Kingdom had been submitted in writing two months before \n2. \nthe working group session by Australia, Brazil, China, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia and the \nUnited  States.  A  list  of  the  questions  received  and  the  answers  provided  by  the  United \nKingdom can be found on the IAR web page for the United Kingdom.1  \n\n3. \nMr.  Lyon  made  an  opening  presentation,  summarizing  the  United  Kingdom’s \nprogress in the implementation of its emission reduction and removal commitments related \nto its quantified economy-wide emission reduction targets.  \n\nHe  presented  the  United  Kingdom’s  target  under  the  Convention  (20  per  cent \n4. \nreduction in emissions by 2020 compared with the 1990 level) and targets for the first and \nsecond commitment periods of the Kyoto Protocol (12.5 per cent reduction in emissions by \n2012 compared with the base year level and a contribution to the joint commitment  of the \nmember States of EU of a 20 per cent reduction in emissions by 2020 compared with the \nbase year level, respectively), as well as the United Kingdom’s contribution to the binding \n(20 per cent reduction in emissions by 2020 compared with the 1990 level) and conditional \n(30 per cent reduction in emissions by 2020 compared with the 1990 level) EU targets. He \nalso  presented  the  United  Kingdom’s  binding  emission  reduction  target  of  80  per  cent \nbelow the 1990 level by 2050, enshrined in the Climate Change Act (2008). \n\n5. \nMr.  Lyon  further  presented  information  on  the  United  Kingdom’s  national \ncircumstances  (population,  energy  demand  and  production,  and  GDP),  followed  by \ninformation  on  progress  made  towards  achieving  the  United  Kingdom’s  targets.  More \nspecifically, he reported on GHG emission trends as well as GHG emissions by sector and \nby gas for 2012. The presentation also detailed total and sectoral GHG emission projections \nfor 2030, including all implemented and adopted policies and measures. Furthermore, total \nand  sectoral  GHG  emissions  avoided  as  a  result  of  the  implementation  of  PaMs  were \nreported by year (2009–2030). Finally, brief information on domestic adaptation and on the \nUnited Kingdom’s International Climate Fund financing activities was presented. \n\n6. \nThe  opening  presentation  was  followed  by  interventions  and  questions  from \nAustralia, Brazil, China, Fiji, Japan, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, Saudi Arabia and \nthe United States. The questions were on: the impact of GHG emission reduction efforts on \nGDP;  GHG  emission  trends  in  the  waste  and  transport  sectors;  PaMs  related  to  future \ntechnological  development,  the  production  of  renewable  energy,  the  built  environment, \ntransportation and domestic and international shipping; and the comparability of the United \nKingdom’s  GHG  emission  reduction  targets  (domestic,  EU,  Kyoto  Protocol  and \nConvention) and the progress  made so far in meeting them.

made equal to 130 per cent of their Kyoto Protocol adjusted \nscale for the relevant biennium; \n\nAlso decides that fees paid by a Party that connects to the international transaction \n5. \nlog for the first time shall be deducted from the resource requirement for activities relating \nto the international transaction log in the next biennium; \n\n6. \nFurther  decides  that  fees  paid  by  a  Party  that  connects  to  the  international \ntransaction  log  for  the  first  time  or,  following  disconnection,  reconnects  to  it  during  the \nbiennium 2016–2017, shall be proportioned for the period between the date of connection \nor reconnection of its registry and the end of the biennium, except for the period for which \nthe fees were already paid; \n\nDecides that, where a Party disconnects during the biennium 2016–2017, the Party \n7. \nshall cover the fees for the full year in which the disconnection took place, and that, if the \ndisconnection takes place in the first year
