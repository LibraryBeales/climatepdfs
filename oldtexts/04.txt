I.  Opening of the session 

(Agenda item 1) 

1. 
The seventh part of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban 
Platform  for  Enhanced  Action  (ADP)  was  held  at  the  United  Nations  Climate  Change 
Conference, Lima, Peru, from 2 to 13 December 2014.1 

2. 
The  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP,  Mr.  Kishan  Kumarsingh  (non-Annex  I)  and  Mr. Artur

on 2 December. They welcomed all Parties and observers. They also welcomed Ms. Anna 
Serzysko (Annex I) as Rapporteur of the ADP.2 

3. 
The  Co-Chairs  stressed  the  need  for  the  ADP  to  provide  to  the  Conference  of  the 
Parties (COP) a clear and solid foundation for the new global climate change agreement to 
be  adopted  at  COP  21,  which  would  signal  to  the  world  the  determination  of  Parties  to 
deliver  a  successful  outcome  at  that  session  of  the  COP,  to  be  held  in  Paris,  France. The 
Co-Chairs reminded delegates of the need to identify the information that will be provided 
in relation to the intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) in accordance with 
decision 1/CP.19 and called for the strengthening and acceleration of climate action prior to 
2020 through a decision that was to be considered and adopted at COP 20.

C.  Organization of the work of the session 

(Agenda item 2(c)) 

At  the  13th  meeting,  on  2  December,  the  Co-Chairs  drew  the  attention  of  the 
8. 
delegates to the scenario note prepared for the seventh part of the session,4 and outlined the 
arrangements made in the light of the organization of work previously agreed by the ADP, 
the  mandates  of  the  ADP,  including  those  given  at  COP  19,5  and  pre-sessional 
consultations.  The  organization  of  the  work  on  agenda  item  3  included  a  contact  group 
established at the fourth part of the session.6  

9. 
At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs stressed the importance of optimizing the use of 
the limited time available and informed the ADP of the greater efforts on time management 
undertaken  by  the  Chairs  of  the  subsidiary  bodies  in  consultation  with  the  Bureau  of  the 
COP and the negotiating groups to strengthen inclusivity, discipline, respect and fairness. 

In addition, the Co-Chairs informed Parties of their intention to hold a special event 

10. 
with observers during the session. This event took place on 5 December. 

III.  Implementation of all the elements of decision 1/CP.17 

(Agenda item 3) 

1.  Proceedings 

The ADP considered this item at its 13th meeting, as well as at its 14th meeting, on 
11. 
13  December.  It  had  before  it  documents  FCCC/ADP/2014/3,  FCCC/ADP/2014/L.4, 
FCCC/ADP/2014/L.5,  FCCC/ADP/2014/CRP.4  and  FCCC/2014/TP/13  and  Add.1–4,  as 
well as the informal notes prepared for the seventh part of the session.7 

12.  At the 13th meeting, the Co-Chairs recalled the establishment of the contact group on 
item 3, referred to in paragraph  8 above, and its  mandate  to  work in accordance  with the 
agreed  agenda  and  established  UNFCCC  practice.  They  also  recalled  the  core  principles 
guiding the work of the ADP, namely that the process will continue to be Party-driven and 
build  on  inputs  from  Parties,  and  that  any  outputs  of  the  process  will  reflect  inputs  from 
Parties.  

13.  At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the attention of delegates to the informal 
documents prepared by the Co-Chairs and aimed at supporting delegates by providing focus

to the negotiations and capturing the progress made by the ADP as well as the submissions 
received, namely: 

(a) 

A non-paper on elements for a draft negotiating text updating the earlier non-

paper;8 

(b)  A  draft  decision  text  on  advancing  the  Durban  Platform  for  Enhanced 

Action.9 

The  Co-Chairs  underlined  the  need  to  continue  the  consideration  and  further 
14. 
elaboration of the elements for a draft negotiating text with a view to making a negotiating 
text available before May 2015, in line with the  mandates contained in decisions 2/CP.18 
and  1/CP.19.  The  Co-Chairs  also  stressed  the  need  for  the  ADP  to  consider  how  to  take 
forward its work on the elements, and how to forward the results of this work to 2015.  

15. 
In  addition,  the  Co-Chairs  informed  the  ADP  of  the  calls  from  Parties  for  textual 
negotiations.  In  this  context,  the  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to  make  specific 
suggestions that seek to build bridges and clarify options so as to allow the contact group to 
collectively  advance  its  work  towards  a  draft  negotiating  text.  In  the  light  of  the  limited 
time  available  to  the  ADP  to  advance  this  work,  the  Co-Chairs  proposed  that  focused 
negotiations in the contact group on the elements for a draft negotiating text be undertaken 
in parallel and facilitated by either one of the Co-Chairs.  

16.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  recalled  the  work  undertaken  by  the  ADP  on 
draft decision texts on the identification of the information that Parties  will provide when 
putting forward their INDCs and on accelerating the implementation of enhanced pre-2020 
climate action. The Co-Chairs proposed that the contact group continue its work on these 
issues  through  textual  negotiations  with  a  view  to  agreeing  on  a  draft  decision  to  be 
recommended for consideration and adoption at COP 20.  

17. 
The Co-Chairs further drew the attention of delegates to the updated technical paper 
titled “Updated compilation of information on the mitigation benefits of actions, initiatives 
and options to enhance mitigation ambition”,10 prepared by the secretariat as requested by 
the  ADP  at  the  third  part  of  its  second  session.11  The  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to 
read  the  updated  technical  paper  and  to  bring  it  to  the  attention  of  the  relevant 
implementation officials in their respective governments.  

18. 
In  the  context  of  pre-2020  action,  the  Co-Chairs  also  informed  the  ADP  of  their 
request to the secretariat to cluster and enhance the visibility of side events and exhibits in 
Lima  that  were  directly  relevant  to  the  thematic  areas  explored  by  the  technical  expert 
meetings in 2014, and that further information on these events and exhibits was available 
on the UNFCCC website.12 

19.  At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the attention of delegates to the high-level 
ministerial  dialogue  on  climate  finance  and  the  high-level  ministerial  dialogue  on  the 
Durban  Platform  for  Enhanced  Action,  which  were  to  be  held  on  9  and  10  December, 
respectively.  They  expressed  their  appreciation  to  Mr.  Manuel  Pulgar-Vidal,  President  of 
COP 20 and the tenth session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the 
Parties to the Kyoto  Protocol (CMP), and his team  for the great efforts  made to facilitate 
the ADP process.

20. 
The  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to  attend  the  numerous  briefings,  forums  and 
events  on  areas  of  relevance  to  the  work  of  the  ADP  being  held  in  Lima  and  informed 
delegates that a list of these events was available on the UNFCCC website.13 

21.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  ADP  agreed  to  the  proposals  by  the  Co-Chairs  on  the 
organization of work by the ADP on item 3.  

22. 
The  ADP  met  on  6  December  to  take  stock  of  progress  made  and  to  consider  the 
possible way forward. Further to this informal meeting and in response to an invitation by 
the President of COP 20/CMP 10, on 8 December the Co-Chairs issued a revised version of 
the draft decision text referred to in paragraph 16 above and of the draft text containing the 
elements  for  a  draft  negotiating  text.  At  the  request  of  Parties,  a  compilation  of  textual 
inputs received from Parties14 was made available on the UNFCCC website.15 

23. 
Following the stocktaking meeting and the issuance of the draft texts referred to in 
paragraph  22  above,  the  ADP  further  focused  its  work,  including  through  line-by-line 
negotiations  on  the  draft  decision  text  on  agenda  item  3.  The  progress  of  this  work  was 
captured in: 

(a) 

A  revised  version  of  the  draft  text  containing  the  elements  for  a  draft 

negotiating text, issued on 10 December;  

(b) 

Revised  versions  of  the  draft  decision  text  on  agenda  item  3  reflecting  the 
status  of  the  negotiations,  made  available  on  the  UNFCCC  website  on  9,  10  and  11 
December.16 

24. 
Progress was also reflected in the oral reports by the ADP Co-Chairs to the informal 
stocktaking  plenaries  convened  by  the  President  of  COP 20/CMP 10  on  10,  11  and  12 
December. 

25. 
In  addition  to  the  consultations  with  Parties  undertaken  by  the  President  of 
COP 20/CMP  10  and  the  ongoing  ADP  negotiations,  on  12  December  the  President 
launched  ministerial  consultations  on  ADP  issues  facilitated  on  his  behalf  by  ministers 
Vivian Balakrishnan (Singapore) and Tine Sundtoft (Norway) with a view to facilitating a 
successful outcome of the ADP process. 

26.  On 13 December, the Co-Chairs convened an informal ADP meeting to introduce a 
further revised draft decision on agenda item 3 with an annex containing the elements for a 
draft negotiating text referred to in paragraph 23(a) above.17 

27.  On  the  same  day,  the  Co-Chairs  opened  the  14th  plenary  meeting  and  invited  the 
ADP to consider the draft decision referred to in paragraph 26 above.  

28.  At  the  beginning  of  the  meeting,  the  President  of  COP 20/CMP 10  recalled  the 
expectations for a successful outcome of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in 
Lima,  which  would  provide  a  solid  foundation  for  reaching  an  agreement  in  Paris.  The 
President  called  for  flexibility  and  encouraged  Parties  to  work  together  to  achieve  the 
successful outcome needed.  

29. 
Statements  were  made  by  representatives  of  41  Parties,  including  on  behalf  of  the 
Environmental Integrity Group, the African Group, the European Union and its 28 member 
States,  the  LDCs,  AILAC,  the  Like-minded  Developing  Countries,  the  League  of  Arab 
States and the BASIC countries.

I.  Opening of the session 

(Agenda item 1) 

1. 
The seventh part of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban 
Platform  for  Enhanced  Action  (ADP)  was  held  at  the  United  Nations  Climate  Change 
Conference, Lima, Peru, from 2 to 13 December 2014.1 

2. 
The  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP,  Mr.  Kishan  Kumarsingh  (non-Annex  I)  and  Mr. Artur 
Runge-Metzger (Annex I), resumed the second session and opened the 13th plenary meeting 
on 2 December. They welcomed all Parties and observers. They also welcomed Ms. Anna 
Serzysko (Annex I) as Rapporteur of the ADP.2 

3. 
The  Co-Chairs  stressed  the  need  for  the  ADP  to  provide  to  the  Conference  of  the 
Parties (COP) a clear and solid foundation for the new global climate change agreement to 
be  adopted  at  COP  21,  which  would  signal  to  the  world  the  determination  of  Parties  to 
deliver  a  successful  outcome  at  that  session  of  the  COP,  to  be  held  in  Paris,  France. The 
Co-Chairs reminded delegates of the need to identify the information that will be provided

10. 
with observers during the session. This event took place on 5 December. 

III.  Implementation of all the elements of decision 1/CP.17 

(Agenda item 3) 

1.  Proceedings 

The ADP considered this item at its 13th meeting, as well as at its 14th meeting, on 
11. 
13  December.  It  had  before  it  documents  FCCC/ADP/2014/3,  FCCC/ADP/2014/L.4, 
FCCC/ADP/2014/L.5,  FCCC/ADP/2014/CRP.4  and  FCCC/2014/TP/13  and  Add.1–4,  as 
well as the informal notes prepared for the seventh part of the session.7 

12.  At the 13th meeting, the Co-Chairs recalled the establishment of the contact group on 
item 3, referred to in paragraph  8 above, and its  mandate  to  work in accordance  with the 
agreed  agenda  and  established  UNFCCC  practice.  They  also  recalled  the  core  principles 
guiding the work of the ADP, namely that the process will continue to be Party-driven and 
build  on  inputs  from  Parties,  and  that  any  outputs  of  the  process  will  reflect  inputs  from 
Parties.  

13.  At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the attention of delegates to the informal 
documents prepared by the Co-Chairs and aimed at supporting delegates by providing focus

to the negotiations and capturing the progress made by the ADP as well as the submissions 
received, namely: 

(a) 

A non-paper on elements for a draft negotiating text updating the earlier non-

paper;8 

(b)  A  draft  decision  text  on  advancing  the  Durban  Platform  for  Enhanced 

Action.9 

The  Co-Chairs  underlined  the  need  to  continue  the  consideration  and  further 
14. 
elaboration of the elements for a draft negotiating text with a view to making a negotiating 
text available before May 2015, in line with the  mandates contained in decisions 2/CP.18 
and  1/CP.19.  The  Co-Chairs  also  stressed  the  need  for  the  ADP  to  consider  how  to  take 
forward its work on the elements, and how to forward the results of this work to 2015.  

15. 
In  addition,  the  Co-Chairs  informed  the  ADP  of  the  calls  from  Parties  for  textual 
negotiations.  In  this  context,  the  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to  make  specific 
suggestions that seek to build bridges and clarify options so as to allow the contact group to 
collectively  advance  its  work  towards  a  draft  negotiating  text.  In  the  light  of  the  limited 
time  available  to  the  ADP  to  advance  this  work,  the  Co-Chairs  proposed  that  focused 
negotiations in the contact group on the elements for a draft negotiating text be undertaken 
in parallel and facilitated by either one of the Co-Chairs.  

16.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  recalled  the  work  undertaken  by  the  ADP  on 
draft decision texts on the identification of the information that Parties  will provide when 
putting forward their INDCs and on accelerating the implementation of enhanced pre-2020 
climate action. The Co-Chairs proposed that the contact group continue its work on these 
issues  through  textual  negotiations  with  a  view  to  agreeing  on  a  draft  decision  to  be 
recommended for consideration and adoption at COP 20.  

17. 
The Co-Chairs further drew the attention of delegates to the updated technical paper 
titled “Updated compilation of information on the mitigation benefits of actions, initiatives 
and options to enhance mitigation ambition”,10 prepared by the secretariat as requested by 
the  ADP  at  the  third  part  of  its  second  session.11  The  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to 
read  the  updated  technical  paper  and  to  bring  it  to  the  attention  of  the  relevant 
implementation officials in their respective governments.  

18. 
In  the  context  of  pre-2020  action,  the  Co-Chairs  also  informed  the  ADP  of  their 
request to the secretariat to cluster and enhance the visibility of side events and exhibits in 
Lima  that  were  directly  relevant  to  the  thematic  areas  explored  by  the  technical  expert 
meetings in 2014, and that further information on these events and exhibits was available 
on the UNFCCC website.12 

19.  At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the attention of delegates to the high-level 
ministerial  dialogue  on  climate  finance  and  the  high-level  ministerial  dialogue  on  the 
Durban  Platform  for  Enhanced  Action,  which  were  to  be  held  on  9  and  10  December, 
respectively.  They  expressed  their  appreciation  to  Mr.  Manuel  Pulgar-Vidal,  President  of 
COP 20 and the tenth session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the 
Parties to the Kyoto  Protocol (CMP), and his team  for the great efforts  made to facilitate 
the ADP process.

20. 
The  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to  attend  the  numerous  briefings,  forums  and 
events  on  areas  of  relevance  to  the  work  of  the  ADP  being  held  in  Lima  and  informed 
delegates that a list of these events was available on the UNFCCC website.13 

21.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  ADP  agreed  to  the  proposals  by  the  Co-Chairs  on  the 
organization of work by the ADP on item 3.  

22. 
The  ADP  met  on  6  December  to  take  stock  of  progress  made  and  to  consider  the 
possible way forward. Further to this informal meeting and in response to an invitation by 
the President of COP 20/CMP 10, on 8 December the Co-Chairs issued a revised version of 
the draft decision text referred to in paragraph 16 above and of the draft text containing the 
elements  for  a  draft  negotiating  text.  At  the  request  of  Parties,  a  compilation  of  textual 
inputs received from Parties14 was made available on the UNFCCC website.15 

23. 
Following the stocktaking meeting and the issuance of the draft texts referred to in 
paragraph  22  above,  the  ADP  further  focused  its  work,  including  through  line-by-line 
negotiations  on  the  draft  decision  text  on  agenda  item  3.  The  progress  of  this  work  was 
captured in: 

(a) 

A  revised  version  of  the  draft  text  containing  the  elements  for  a  draft 

negotiating text, issued on 10 December;  

(b) 

Revised  versions  of  the  draft  decision  text  on  agenda  item  3  reflecting  the 
status  of  the  negotiations,  made  available  on  the  UNFCCC  website  on  9,  10  and  11 
December.16 

24. 
Progress was also reflected in the oral reports by the ADP Co-Chairs to the informal 
stocktaking  plenaries  convened  by  the  President  of  COP 20/CMP 10  on  10,  11  and  12 
December. 

25. 
In  addition  to  the  consultations  with  Parties  undertaken  by  the  President  of 
COP 20/CMP  10  and  the  ongoing  ADP  negotiations,  on  12  December  the  President 
launched  ministerial  consultations  on  ADP  issues  facilitated  on  his  behalf  by  ministers 
Vivian Balakrishnan (Singapore) and Tine Sundtoft (Norway) with a view to facilitating a 
successful outcome of the ADP process. 

26.  On 13 December, the Co-Chairs convened an informal ADP meeting to introduce a 
further revised draft decision on agenda item 3 with an annex containing the elements for a 
draft negotiating text referred to in paragraph 23(a) above.17 

27.  On  the  same  day,  the  Co-Chairs  opened  the  14th  plenary  meeting  and  invited  the 
ADP to consider the draft decision referred to in paragraph 26 above.  

28.  At  the  beginning  of  the  meeting,  the  President  of  COP 20/CMP 10  recalled  the 
expectations for a successful outcome of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in 
Lima,  which  would  provide  a  solid  foundation  for  reaching  an  agreement  in  Paris.  The 
President  called  for  flexibility  and  encouraged  Parties  to  work  together  to  achieve  the 
successful outcome needed.  

29. 
Statements  were  made  by  representatives  of  41  Parties,  including  on  behalf  of  the 
Environmental Integrity Group, the African Group, the European Union and its 28 member 
States,  the  LDCs,  AILAC,  the  Like-minded  Developing  Countries,  the  League  of  Arab 
States and the BASIC countries.

deliver  a  successful  outcome  at  that  session  of  the  COP,  to  be  held  in  Paris,  France. The 
Co-Chairs reminded delegates of the need to identify the information that will be provided

arrangements made in the light of the organization of work previously agreed by the ADP, 
the  mandates  of  the  ADP,  including  those  given  at  COP  19,5  and  pre-sessional 
consultations.  The  organization  of  the  work  on  agenda  item  3  included  a  contact  group 
established at the fourth part of the session.6  

9. 
At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs stressed the importance of optimizing the use of 
the limited time available and informed the ADP of the greater efforts on time management 
undertaken  by  the  Chairs  of  the  subsidiary  bodies  in  consultation  with  the  Bureau  of  the 
COP and the negotiating groups to strengthen inclusivity, discipline, respect and fairness. 

In addition, the Co-Chairs informed Parties of their intention to hold a special event 

10. 
with observers during the session. This event took place on 5 December. 

III.  Implementation of all the elements of decision 1/CP.17 

(Agenda item 3) 

1.  Proceedings 

The ADP considered this item at its 13th meeting, as well as at its 14th meeting, on 
11. 
13  December.  It  had  before  it  documents  FCCC/ADP/2014/3,  FCCC/ADP/2014/L.4, 
FCCC/ADP/2014/L.5,  FCCC/ADP/2014/CRP.4  and  FCCC/2014/TP/13  and  Add.1–4,  as 
well as the informal notes prepared for the seventh part of the session.7 

12.  At the 13th meeting, the Co-Chairs recalled the establishment of the contact group on 
item 3, referred to in paragraph  8 above, and its  mandate  to  work in accordance  with the 
agreed  agenda  and  established  UNFCCC  practice.  They  also  recalled  the  core  principles 
guiding the work of the ADP, namely that the process will continue to be Party-driven and 
build  on  inputs  from  Parties,  and  that  any  outputs  of  the  process  will  reflect  inputs  from 
Parties.  

13.  At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the attention of delegates to the informal 
documents prepared by the Co-Chairs and aimed at supporting delegates by providing focus

to the negotiations and capturing the progress made by the ADP as well as the submissions 
received, namely: 

(a) 

A non-paper on elements for a draft negotiating text updating the earlier non-

paper;8 

(b)  A  draft  decision  text  on  advancing  the  Durban  Platform  for  Enhanced 

Action.9 

The  Co-Chairs  underlined  the  need  to  continue  the  consideration  and  further 
14. 
elaboration of the elements for a draft negotiating text with a view to making a negotiating 
text available before May 2015, in line with the  mandates contained in decisions 2/CP.18 
and  1/CP.19.  The  Co-Chairs  also  stressed  the  need  for  the  ADP  to  consider  how  to  take 
forward its work on the elements, and how to forward the results of this work to 2015.  

15. 
In  addition,  the  Co-Chairs  informed  the  ADP  of  the  calls  from  Parties  for  textual 
negotiations.  In  this  context,  the  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to  make  specific 
suggestions that seek to build bridges and clarify options so as to allow the contact group to 
collectively  advance  its  work  towards  a  draft  negotiating  text.  In  the  light  of  the  limited 
time  available  to  the  ADP  to  advance  this  work,  the  Co-Chairs  proposed  that  focused 
negotiations in the contact group on the elements for a draft negotiating text be undertaken 
in parallel and facilitated by either one of the Co-Chairs.  

16.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  recalled  the  work  undertaken  by  the  ADP  on 
draft decision texts on the identification of the information that Parties  will provide when 
putting forward their INDCs and on accelerating the implementation of enhanced pre-2020 
climate action. The Co-Chairs proposed that the contact group continue its work on these 
issues  through  textual  negotiations  with  a  view  to  agreeing  on  a  draft  decision  to  be 
recommended for consideration and adoption at COP 20.  

17. 
The Co-Chairs further drew the attention of delegates to the updated technical paper 
titled “Updated compilation of information on the mitigation benefits of actions, initiatives 
and options to enhance mitigation ambition”,10 prepared by the secretariat as requested by 
the  ADP  at  the  third  part  of  its  second  session.11  The  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to 
read  the  updated  technical  paper  and  to  bring  it  to  the  attention  of  the  relevant 
implementation officials in their respective governments.  

18. 
In  the  context  of  pre-2020  action,  the  Co-Chairs  also  informed  the  ADP  of  their 
request to the secretariat to cluster and enhance the visibility of side events and exhibits in 
Lima  that  were  directly  relevant  to  the  thematic  areas  explored  by  the  technical  expert 
meetings in 2014, and that further information on these events and exhibits was available 
on the UNFCCC website.12 

19.  At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the attention of delegates to the high-level 
ministerial  dialogue  on  climate  finance  and  the  high-level  ministerial  dialogue  on  the 
Durban  Platform  for  Enhanced  Action,  which  were  to  be  held  on  9  and  10  December, 
respectively.  They  expressed  their  appreciation  to  Mr.  Manuel  Pulgar-Vidal,  President  of 
COP 20 and the tenth session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the 
Parties to the Kyoto  Protocol (CMP), and his team  for the great efforts  made to facilitate 
the ADP process.

20. 
The  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to  attend  the  numerous  briefings,  forums  and 
events  on  areas  of  relevance  to  the  work  of  the  ADP  being  held  in  Lima  and  informed 
delegates that a list of these events was available on the UNFCCC website.13 

21.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  ADP  agreed  to  the  proposals  by  the  Co-Chairs  on  the 
organization of work by the ADP on item 3.  

22. 
The  ADP  met  on  6  December  to  take  stock  of  progress  made  and  to  consider  the 
possible way forward. Further to this informal meeting and in response to an invitation by 
the President of COP 20/CMP 10, on 8 December the Co-Chairs issued a revised version of 
the draft decision text referred to in paragraph 16 above and of the draft text containing the 
elements  for  a  draft  negotiating  text.  At  the  request  of  Parties,  a  compilation  of  textual 
inputs received from Parties14 was made available on the UNFCCC website.15 

23. 
Following the stocktaking meeting and the issuance of the draft texts referred to in 
paragraph  22  above,  the  ADP  further  focused  its  work,  including  through  line-by-line 
negotiations  on  the  draft  decision  text  on  agenda  item  3.  The  progress  of  this  work  was 
captured in: 

(a) 

A  revised  version  of  the  draft  text  containing  the  elements  for  a  draft 

negotiating text, issued on 10 December;  

(b) 

Revised  versions  of  the  draft  decision  text  on  agenda  item  3  reflecting  the 
status  of  the  negotiations,  made  available  on  the  UNFCCC  website  on  9,  10  and  11 
December.16 

24. 
Progress was also reflected in the oral reports by the ADP Co-Chairs to the informal 
stocktaking  plenaries  convened  by  the  President  of  COP 20/CMP 10  on  10,  11  and  12 
December. 

25. 
In  addition  to  the  consultations  with  Parties  undertaken  by  the  President  of 
COP 20/CMP  10  and  the  ongoing  ADP  negotiations,  on  12  December  the  President 
launched  ministerial  consultations  on  ADP  issues  facilitated  on  his  behalf  by  ministers 
Vivian Balakrishnan (Singapore) and Tine Sundtoft (Norway) with a view to facilitating a 
successful outcome of the ADP process. 

26.  On 13 December, the Co-Chairs convened an informal ADP meeting to introduce a 
further revised draft decision on agenda item 3 with an annex containing the elements for a 
draft negotiating text referred to in paragraph 23(a) above.17 

27.  On  the  same  day,  the  Co-Chairs  opened  the  14th  plenary  meeting  and  invited  the 
ADP to consider the draft decision referred to in paragraph 26 above.  

28.  At  the  beginning  of  the  meeting,  the  President  of  COP 20/CMP 10  recalled  the 
expectations for a successful outcome of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in 
Lima,  which  would  provide  a  solid  foundation  for  reaching  an  agreement  in  Paris.  The 
President  called  for  flexibility  and  encouraged  Parties  to  work  together  to  achieve  the 
successful outcome needed.  

29. 
Statements  were  made  by  representatives  of  41  Parties,  including  on  behalf  of  the 
Environmental Integrity Group, the African Group, the European Union and its 28 member 
States,  the  LDCs,  AILAC,  the  Like-minded  Developing  Countries,  the  League  of  Arab 
States and the BASIC countries.

I.  Opening of the session 

(Agenda item 1) 

1. 
The seventh part of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban 
Platform  for  Enhanced  Action  (ADP)  was  held  at  the  United  Nations  Climate  Change 
Conference, Lima, Peru, from 2 to 13 December 2014.1 

2. 
The  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP,  Mr.  Kishan  Kumarsingh  (non-Annex  I)  and  Mr. Artur

The  Co-Chairs  stressed  the  need  for  the  ADP  to  provide  to  the  Conference  of  the 
Parties (COP) a clear and solid foundation for the new global climate change agreement to 
be  adopted  at  COP  21,  which  would  signal  to  the  world  the  determination  of  Parties  to 
deliver  a  successful  outcome  at  that  session  of  the  COP,  to  be  held  in  Paris,  France. The 
Co-Chairs reminded delegates of the need to identify the information that will be provided 
in relation to the intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) in accordance with 
decision 1/CP.19 and called for the strengthening and acceleration of climate action prior to 
2020 through a decision that was to be considered and adopted at COP 20.

C.  Organization of the work of the session 

(Agenda item 2(c)) 

At  the  13th  meeting,  on  2  December,  the  Co-Chairs  drew  the  attention  of  the 
8. 
delegates to the scenario note prepared for the seventh part of the session,4 and outlined the 
arrangements made in the light of the organization of work previously agreed by the ADP, 
the  mandates  of  the  ADP,  including  those  given  at  COP  19,5  and  pre-sessional 
consultations.  The  organization  of  the  work  on  agenda  item  3  included  a  contact  group 
established at the fourth part of the session.6  

9. 
At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs stressed the importance of optimizing the use of 
the limited time available and informed the ADP of the greater efforts on time management 
undertaken  by  the  Chairs  of  the  subsidiary  bodies  in  consultation  with  the  Bureau  of  the 
COP and the negotiating groups to strengthen inclusivity, discipline, respect and fairness. 

In addition, the Co-Chairs informed Parties of their intention to hold a special event

with observers during the session. This event took place on 5 December. 

III.  Implementation of all the elements of decision 1/CP.17 

(Agenda item 3) 

1.  Proceedings 

The ADP considered this item at its 13th meeting, as well as at its 14th meeting, on 
11. 
13  December.  It  had  before  it  documents  FCCC/ADP/2014/3,  FCCC/ADP/2014/L.4,

agreed  agenda  and  established  UNFCCC  practice.  They  also  recalled  the  core  principles 
guiding the work of the ADP, namely that the process will continue to be Party-driven and 
build  on  inputs  from  Parties,  and  that  any  outputs  of  the  process  will  reflect  inputs  from 
Parties.  

13.  At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the attention of delegates to the informal

to the negotiations and capturing the progress made by the ADP as well as the submissions 
received, namely: 

(a) 

A non-paper on elements for a draft negotiating text updating the earlier non-

paper;8 

(b)  A  draft  decision  text  on  advancing  the  Durban  Platform  for  Enhanced 

Action.9 

The  Co-Chairs  underlined  the  need  to  continue  the  consideration  and  further 
14. 
elaboration of the elements for a draft negotiating text with a view to making a negotiating 
text available before May 2015, in line with the  mandates contained in decisions 2/CP.18 
and  1/CP.19.  The  Co-Chairs  also  stressed  the  need  for  the  ADP  to  consider  how  to  take 
forward its work on the elements, and how to forward the results of this work to 2015.  

15. 
In  addition,  the  Co-Chairs  informed  the  ADP  of  the  calls  from  Parties  for  textual 
negotiations.  In  this  context,  the  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to  make  specific 
suggestions that seek to build bridges and clarify options so as to allow the contact group to 
collectively  advance  its  work  towards  a  draft  negotiating  text.  In  the  light  of  the  limited 
time  available  to  the  ADP  to  advance  this  work,  the  Co-Chairs  proposed  that  focused 
negotiations in the contact group on the elements for a draft negotiating text be undertaken 
in parallel and facilitated by either one of the Co-Chairs.  

16.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  recalled  the  work  undertaken  by  the  ADP  on 
draft decision texts on the identification of the information that Parties  will provide when 
putting forward their INDCs and on accelerating the implementation of enhanced pre-2020 
climate action. The Co-Chairs proposed that the contact group continue its work on these 
issues  through  textual  negotiations  with  a  view  to  agreeing  on  a  draft  decision  to  be 
recommended for consideration and adoption at COP 20.  

17. 
The Co-Chairs further drew the attention of delegates to the updated technical paper 
titled “Updated compilation of information on the mitigation benefits of actions, initiatives 
and options to enhance mitigation ambition”,10 prepared by the secretariat as requested by 
the  ADP  at  the  third  part  of  its  second  session.11  The  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to 
read  the  updated  technical  paper  and  to  bring  it  to  the  attention  of  the  relevant 
implementation officials in their respective governments.  

18. 
In  the  context  of  pre-2020  action,  the  Co-Chairs  also  informed  the  ADP  of  their 
request to the secretariat to cluster and enhance the visibility of side events and exhibits in 
Lima  that  were  directly  relevant  to  the  thematic  areas  explored  by  the  technical  expert 
meetings in 2014, and that further information on these events and exhibits was available 
on the UNFCCC website.12 

19.  At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the attention of delegates to the high-level 
ministerial  dialogue  on  climate  finance  and  the  high-level  ministerial  dialogue  on  the 
Durban  Platform  for  Enhanced  Action,  which  were  to  be  held  on  9  and  10  December, 
respectively.  They  expressed  their  appreciation  to  Mr.  Manuel  Pulgar-Vidal,  President  of 
COP 20 and the tenth session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the 
Parties to the Kyoto  Protocol (CMP), and his team  for the great efforts  made to facilitate 
the ADP process.

20. 
The  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to  attend  the  numerous  briefings,  forums  and 
events  on  areas  of  relevance  to  the  work  of  the  ADP  being  held  in  Lima  and  informed 
delegates that a list of these events was available on the UNFCCC website.13 

21.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  ADP  agreed  to  the  proposals  by  the  Co-Chairs  on  the 
organization of work by the ADP on item 3.  

22. 
The  ADP  met  on  6  December  to  take  stock  of  progress  made  and  to  consider  the 
possible way forward. Further to this informal meeting and in response to an invitation by 
the President of COP 20/CMP 10, on 8 December the Co-Chairs issued a revised version of 
the draft decision text referred to in paragraph 16 above and of the draft text containing the 
elements  for  a  draft  negotiating  text.  At  the  request  of  Parties,  a  compilation  of  textual 
inputs received from Parties14 was made available on the UNFCCC website.15 

23. 
Following the stocktaking meeting and the issuance of the draft texts referred to in 
paragraph  22  above,  the  ADP  further  focused  its  work,  including  through  line-by-line 
negotiations  on  the  draft  decision  text  on  agenda  item  3.  The  progress  of  this  work  was 
captured in: 

(a) 

A  revised  version  of  the  draft  text  containing  the  elements  for  a  draft 

negotiating text, issued on 10 December;  

(b) 

Revised  versions  of  the  draft  decision  text  on  agenda  item  3  reflecting  the 
status  of  the  negotiations,  made  available  on  the  UNFCCC  website  on  9,  10  and  11 
December.16 

24. 
Progress was also reflected in the oral reports by the ADP Co-Chairs to the informal 
stocktaking  plenaries  convened  by  the  President  of  COP 20/CMP 10  on  10,  11  and  12 
December. 

25. 
In  addition  to  the  consultations  with  Parties  undertaken  by  the  President  of 
COP 20/CMP  10  and  the  ongoing  ADP  negotiations,  on  12  December  the  President 
launched  ministerial  consultations  on  ADP  issues  facilitated  on  his  behalf  by  ministers 
Vivian Balakrishnan (Singapore) and Tine Sundtoft (Norway) with a view to facilitating a 
successful outcome of the ADP process. 

26.  On 13 December, the Co-Chairs convened an informal ADP meeting to introduce a 
further revised draft decision on agenda item 3 with an annex containing the elements for a 
draft negotiating text referred to in paragraph 23(a) above.17 

27.  On  the  same  day,  the  Co-Chairs  opened  the  14th  plenary  meeting  and  invited  the 
ADP to consider the draft decision referred to in paragraph 26 above.  

28.  At  the  beginning  of  the  meeting,  the  President  of  COP 20/CMP 10  recalled  the 
expectations for a successful outcome of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in 
Lima,  which  would  provide  a  solid  foundation  for  reaching  an  agreement  in  Paris.  The 
President  called  for  flexibility  and  encouraged  Parties  to  work  together  to  achieve  the 
successful outcome needed.  

29. 
Statements  were  made  by  representatives  of  41  Parties,  including  on  behalf  of  the 
Environmental Integrity Group, the African Group, the European Union and its 28 member 
States,  the  LDCs,  AILAC,  the  Like-minded  Developing  Countries,  the  League  of  Arab 
States and the BASIC countries.

I.  Opening of the session 

(Agenda item 1) 

1. 
The seventh part of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban 
Platform  for  Enhanced  Action  (ADP)  was  held  at  the  United  Nations  Climate  Change 
Conference, Lima, Peru, from 2 to 13 December 2014.1 

2. 
The  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP,  Mr.  Kishan  Kumarsingh  (non-Annex  I)  and  Mr. Artur 
Runge-Metzger (Annex I), resumed the second session and opened the 13th plenary meeting 
on 2 December. They welcomed all Parties and observers. They also welcomed Ms. Anna 
Serzysko (Annex I) as Rapporteur of the ADP.2 

3. 
The  Co-Chairs  stressed  the  need  for  the  ADP  to  provide  to  the  Conference  of  the 
Parties (COP) a clear and solid foundation for the new global climate change agreement to 
be  adopted  at  COP  21,  which  would  signal  to  the  world  the  determination  of  Parties  to 
deliver  a  successful  outcome  at  that  session  of  the  COP,  to  be  held  in  Paris,  France. The 
Co-Chairs reminded delegates of the need to identify the information that will be provided 
in relation to the intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) in accordance with 
decision 1/CP.19 and called for the strengthening and acceleration of climate action prior to 
2020 through a decision that was to be considered and adopted at COP 20. 

4.

Group  of  77  and  China,  the  European  Union  and  its  28  member  States,  the  Umbrella 
Group, the Environmental Integrity Group, the African Group, the Alliance of Small Island 
States,  the  least  developed  countries  (LDCs),  the  Independent  Association  for  Latin 
America and the Caribbean (AILAC), the Central American Integration System, the League 
of  Arab  States,  the  BASIC  countries  (Brazil,  China,  India  and  South  Africa),  the  Like-
minded  Developing  Countries  and  the  Coalition  for  Rainforest  Nations.  In  addition, 
statements  were  made  on  behalf  of  environmental  non-governmental  organizations 
(NGOs), farmers NGOs, indigenous peoples organizations, local government and municipal 
authorities,  trade  union  NGOs,  women  and  gender  NGOs,  youth  NGOs  and  business  and 
industry NGOs.  

II.  Organizational matters 

(Agenda item 2) 

A.  Election of officers 
(Agenda item 2(a)) 

The  ADP  considered  this  sub-item  at  its  14th  meeting,  on  13  December.  The  Co-

B.  Adoption of the agenda 

(Agenda item 2(b)) 

The  agenda  for  the  second  session  of  the  ADP  was  adopted  by  the  ADP  at  the  1st 

7. 
meeting of the session, on 29 April 2013.3  

C.  Organization of the work of the session 

(Agenda item 2(c)) 

At  the  13th  meeting,  on  2  December,  the  Co-Chairs  drew  the  attention  of  the 
8. 
delegates to the scenario note prepared for the seventh part of the session,4 and outlined the 
arrangements made in the light of the organization of work previously agreed by the ADP, 
the  mandates  of  the  ADP,  including  those  given  at  COP  19,5  and  pre-sessional 
consultations.  The  organization  of  the  work  on  agenda  item  3  included  a  contact  group 
established at the fourth part of the session.6  

9. 
At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs stressed the importance of optimizing the use of 
the limited time available and informed the ADP of the greater efforts on time management 
undertaken  by  the  Chairs  of  the  subsidiary  bodies  in  consultation  with  the  Bureau  of  the 
COP and the negotiating groups to strengthen inclusivity, discipline, respect and fairness. 

In addition, the Co-Chairs informed Parties of their intention to hold a special event 

10. 
with observers during the session. This event took place on 5 December. 

III.  Implementation of all the elements of decision 1/CP.17 

(Agenda item 3) 

1.  Proceedings 

The ADP considered this item at its 13th meeting, as well as at its 14th meeting, on 
11. 
13  December.  It  had  before  it  documents  FCCC/ADP/2014/3,  FCCC/ADP/2014/L.4, 
FCCC/ADP/2014/L.5,  FCCC/ADP/2014/CRP.4  and  FCCC/2014/TP/13  and  Add.1–4,  as 
well as the informal notes prepared for the seventh part of the session.7 

12.  At the 13th meeting, the Co-Chairs recalled the establishment of the contact group on 
item 3, referred to in paragraph  8 above, and its  mandate  to  work in accordance  with the 
agreed  agenda  and  established  UNFCCC  practice.  They  also  recalled  the  core  principles 
guiding the work of the ADP, namely that the process will continue to be Party-driven and 
build  on  inputs  from  Parties,  and  that  any  outputs  of  the  process  will  reflect  inputs  from 
Parties.  

13.  At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the attention of delegates to the informal 
documents prepared by the Co-Chairs and aimed at supporting delegates by providing focus

to the negotiations and capturing the progress made by the ADP as well as the submissions 
received, namely: 

(a) 

A non-paper on elements for a draft negotiating text updating the earlier non-

paper;8 

(b)  A  draft  decision  text  on  advancing  the  Durban  Platform  for  Enhanced 

Action.9 

The  Co-Chairs  underlined  the  need  to  continue  the  consideration  and  further 
14. 
elaboration of the elements for a draft negotiating text with a view to making a negotiating 
text available before May 2015, in line with the  mandates contained in decisions 2/CP.18 
and  1/CP.19.  The  Co-Chairs  also  stressed  the  need  for  the  ADP  to  consider  how  to  take 
forward its work on the elements, and how to forward the results of this work to 2015.  

15. 
In  addition,  the  Co-Chairs  informed  the  ADP  of  the  calls  from  Parties  for  textual 
negotiations.  In  this  context,  the  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to  make  specific 
suggestions that seek to build bridges and clarify options so as to allow the contact group to 
collectively  advance  its  work  towards  a  draft  negotiating  text.  In  the  light  of  the  limited 
time  available  to  the  ADP  to  advance  this  work,  the  Co-Chairs  proposed  that  focused 
negotiations in the contact group on the elements for a draft negotiating text be undertaken 
in parallel and facilitated by either one of the Co-Chairs.  

16.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  recalled  the  work  undertaken  by  the  ADP  on 
draft decision texts on the identification of the information that Parties  will provide when 
putting forward their INDCs and on accelerating the implementation of enhanced pre-2020 
climate action. The Co-Chairs proposed that the contact group continue its work on these 
issues  through  textual  negotiations  with  a  view  to  agreeing  on  a  draft  decision  to  be 
recommended for consideration and adoption at COP 20.  

17. 
The Co-Chairs further drew the attention of delegates to the updated technical paper 
titled “Updated compilation of information on the mitigation benefits of actions, initiatives 
and options to enhance mitigation ambition”,10 prepared by the secretariat as requested by 
the  ADP  at  the  third  part  of  its  second  session.11  The  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to 
read  the  updated  technical  paper  and  to  bring  it  to  the  attention  of  the  relevant 
implementation officials in their respective governments.  

18. 
In  the  context  of  pre-2020  action,  the  Co-Chairs  also  informed  the  ADP  of  their 
request to the secretariat to cluster and enhance the visibility of side events and exhibits in 
Lima  that  were  directly  relevant  to  the  thematic  areas  explored  by  the  technical  expert 
meetings in 2014, and that further information on these events and exhibits was available 
on the UNFCCC website.12 

19.  At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the attention of delegates to the high-level 
ministerial  dialogue  on  climate  finance  and  the  high-level  ministerial  dialogue  on  the 
Durban  Platform  for  Enhanced  Action,  which  were  to  be  held  on  9  and  10  December, 
respectively.  They  expressed  their  appreciation  to  Mr.  Manuel  Pulgar-Vidal,  President  of 
COP 20 and the tenth session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the 
Parties to the Kyoto  Protocol (CMP), and his team  for the great efforts  made to facilitate 
the ADP process.

20. 
The  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to  attend  the  numerous  briefings,  forums  and 
events  on  areas  of  relevance  to  the  work  of  the  ADP  being  held  in  Lima  and  informed 
delegates that a list of these events was available on the UNFCCC website.13 

21.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  ADP  agreed  to  the  proposals  by  the  Co-Chairs  on  the 
organization of work by the ADP on item 3.  

22. 
The  ADP  met  on  6  December  to  take  stock  of  progress  made  and  to  consider  the 
possible way forward. Further to this informal meeting and in response to an invitation by 
the President of COP 20/CMP 10, on 8 December the Co-Chairs issued a revised version of 
the draft decision text referred to in paragraph 16 above and of the draft text containing the 
elements  for  a  draft  negotiating  text.  At  the  request  of  Parties,  a  compilation  of  textual 
inputs received from Parties14 was made available on the UNFCCC website.15 

23. 
Following the stocktaking meeting and the issuance of the draft texts referred to in 
paragraph  22  above,  the  ADP  further  focused  its  work,  including  through  line-by-line 
negotiations  on  the  draft  decision  text  on  agenda  item  3.  The  progress  of  this  work  was 
captured in: 

(a) 

A  revised  version  of  the  draft  text  containing  the  elements  for  a  draft 

negotiating text, issued on 10 December;  

(b) 

Revised  versions  of  the  draft  decision  text  on  agenda  item  3  reflecting  the 
status  of  the  negotiations,  made  available  on  the  UNFCCC  website  on  9,  10  and  11 
December.16 

24. 
Progress was also reflected in the oral reports by the ADP Co-Chairs to the informal 
stocktaking  plenaries  convened  by  the  President  of  COP 20/CMP 10  on  10,  11  and  12 
December. 

25. 
In  addition  to  the  consultations  with  Parties  undertaken  by  the  President  of 
COP 20/CMP  10  and  the  ongoing  ADP  negotiations,  on  12  December  the  President 
launched  ministerial  consultations  on  ADP  issues  facilitated  on  his  behalf  by  ministers 
Vivian Balakrishnan (Singapore) and Tine Sundtoft (Norway) with a view to facilitating a 
successful outcome of the ADP process. 

26.  On 13 December, the Co-Chairs convened an informal ADP meeting to introduce a 
further revised draft decision on agenda item 3 with an annex containing the elements for a 
draft negotiating text referred to in paragraph 23(a) above.17 

27.  On  the  same  day,  the  Co-Chairs  opened  the  14th  plenary  meeting  and  invited  the 
ADP to consider the draft decision referred to in paragraph 26 above.  

28.  At  the  beginning  of  the  meeting,  the  President  of  COP 20/CMP 10  recalled  the 
expectations for a successful outcome of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in 
Lima,  which  would  provide  a  solid  foundation  for  reaching  an  agreement  in  Paris.  The 
President  called  for  flexibility  and  encouraged  Parties  to  work  together  to  achieve  the 
successful outcome needed.  

29. 
Statements  were  made  by  representatives  of  41  Parties,  including  on  behalf  of  the 
Environmental Integrity Group, the African Group, the European Union and its 28 member 
States,  the  LDCs,  AILAC,  the  Like-minded  Developing  Countries,  the  League  of  Arab 
States and the BASIC countries.

I.  Opening of the session 

(Agenda item 1) 

1. 
The seventh part of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban 
Platform  for  Enhanced  Action  (ADP)  was  held  at  the  United  Nations  Climate  Change 
Conference, Lima, Peru, from 2 to 13 December 2014.1 

2. 
The  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP,  Mr.  Kishan  Kumarsingh  (non-Annex  I)  and  Mr. Artur 
Runge-Metzger (Annex I), resumed the second session and opened the 13th plenary meeting 
on 2 December. They welcomed all Parties and observers. They also welcomed Ms. Anna 
Serzysko (Annex I) as Rapporteur of the ADP.2 

3. 
The  Co-Chairs  stressed  the  need  for  the  ADP  to  provide  to  the  Conference  of  the 
Parties (COP) a clear and solid foundation for the new global climate change agreement to 
be  adopted  at  COP  21,  which  would  signal  to  the  world  the  determination  of  Parties  to 
deliver  a  successful  outcome  at  that  session  of  the  COP,  to  be  held  in  Paris,  France. The 
Co-Chairs reminded delegates of the need to identify the information that will be provided 
in relation to the intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) in accordance with 
decision 1/CP.19 and called for the strengthening and acceleration of climate action prior to 
2020 through a decision that was to be considered and adopted at COP 20. 

4. 
Statements  were  made  by  representatives  of  13  Parties,  including  on  behalf  of  the 
Group  of  77  and  China,  the  European  Union  and  its  28  member  States,  the  Umbrella 
Group, the Environmental Integrity Group, the African Group, the Alliance of Small Island 
States,  the  least  developed  countries  (LDCs),  the  Independent  Association  for  Latin 
America and the Caribbean (AILAC), the Central American Integration System, the League 
of  Arab  States,  the  BASIC  countries  (Brazil,  China,  India  and  South  Africa),  the  Like-
minded  Developing  Countries  and  the  Coalition  for  Rainforest  Nations.  In  addition, 
statements  were  made  on  behalf  of  environmental  non-governmental  organizations 
(NGOs), farmers NGOs, indigenous peoples organizations, local government and municipal 
authorities,  trade  union  NGOs,  women  and  gender  NGOs,  youth  NGOs  and  business  and 
industry NGOs.  

II.  Organizational matters 

(Agenda item 2) 

A.  Election of officers 
(Agenda item 2(a)) 

The  ADP  considered  this  sub-item  at  its  14th  meeting,  on  13  December.  The  Co-

B.  Adoption of the agenda 

(Agenda item 2(b)) 

The  agenda  for  the  second  session  of  the  ADP  was  adopted  by  the  ADP  at  the  1st 

7. 
meeting of the session, on 29 April 2013.3  

C.  Organization of the work of the session 

(Agenda item 2(c)) 

At  the  13th  meeting,  on  2  December,  the  Co-Chairs  drew  the  attention  of  the 
8. 
delegates to the scenario note prepared for the seventh part of the session,4 and outlined the 
arrangements made in the light of the organization of work previously agreed by the ADP, 
the  mandates  of  the  ADP,  including  those  given  at  COP  19,5  and  pre-sessional 
consultations.  The  organization  of  the  work  on  agenda  item  3  included  a  contact  group 
established at the fourth part of the session.6  

9. 
At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs stressed the importance of optimizing the use of 
the limited time available and informed the ADP of the greater efforts on time management 
undertaken  by  the  Chairs  of  the  subsidiary  bodies  in  consultation  with  the  Bureau  of  the 
COP and the negotiating groups to strengthen inclusivity, discipline, respect and fairness. 

In addition, the Co-Chairs informed Parties of their intention to hold a special event 

10. 
with observers during the session. This event took place on 5 December. 

III.  Implementation of all the elements of decision 1/CP.17 

(Agenda item 3) 

1.  Proceedings 

The ADP considered this item at its 13th meeting, as well as at its 14th meeting, on 
11. 
13  December.  It  had  before  it  documents  FCCC/ADP/2014/3,  FCCC/ADP/2014/L.4, 
FCCC/ADP/2014/L.5,  FCCC/ADP/2014/CRP.4  and  FCCC/2014/TP/13  and  Add.1–4,  as 
well as the informal notes prepared for the seventh part of the session.7 

12.  At the 13th meeting, the Co-Chairs recalled the establishment of the contact group on 
item 3, referred to in paragraph  8 above, and its  mandate  to  work in accordance  with the 
agreed  agenda  and  established  UNFCCC  practice.  They  also  recalled  the  core  principles 
guiding the work of the ADP, namely that the process will continue to be Party-driven and 
build  on  inputs  from  Parties,  and  that  any  outputs  of  the  process  will  reflect  inputs  from 
Parties.  

13.  At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the attention of delegates to the informal 
documents prepared by the Co-Chairs and aimed at supporting delegates by providing focus

to the negotiations and capturing the progress made by the ADP as well as the submissions 
received, namely: 

(a) 

A non-paper on elements for a draft negotiating text updating the earlier non-

paper;8 

(b)  A  draft  decision  text  on  advancing  the  Durban  Platform  for  Enhanced 

Action.9 

The  Co-Chairs  underlined  the  need  to  continue  the  consideration  and  further 
14. 
elaboration of the elements for a draft negotiating text with a view to making a negotiating 
text available before May 2015, in line with the  mandates contained in decisions 2/CP.18 
and  1/CP.19.  The  Co-Chairs  also  stressed  the  need  for  the  ADP  to  consider  how  to  take 
forward its work on the elements, and how to forward the results of this work to 2015.  

15. 
In  addition,  the  Co-Chairs  informed  the  ADP  of  the  calls  from  Parties  for  textual 
negotiations.  In  this  context,  the  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to  make  specific 
suggestions that seek to build bridges and clarify options so as to allow the contact group to 
collectively  advance  its  work  towards  a  draft  negotiating  text.  In  the  light  of  the  limited 
time  available  to  the  ADP  to  advance  this  work,  the  Co-Chairs  proposed  that  focused 
negotiations in the contact group on the elements for a draft negotiating text be undertaken 
in parallel and facilitated by either one of the Co-Chairs.  

16.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  recalled  the  work  undertaken  by  the  ADP  on 
draft decision texts on the identification of the information that Parties  will provide when 
putting forward their INDCs and on accelerating the implementation of enhanced pre-2020 
climate action. The Co-Chairs proposed that the contact group continue its work on these 
issues  through  textual  negotiations  with  a  view  to  agreeing  on  a  draft  decision  to  be 
recommended for consideration and adoption at COP 20.  

17. 
The Co-Chairs further drew the attention of delegates to the updated technical paper 
titled “Updated compilation of information on the mitigation benefits of actions, initiatives 
and options to enhance mitigation ambition”,10 prepared by the secretariat as requested by 
the  ADP  at  the  third  part  of  its  second  session.11  The  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to 
read  the  updated  technical  paper  and  to  bring  it  to  the  attention  of  the  relevant 
implementation officials in their respective governments.  

18. 
In  the  context  of  pre-2020  action,  the  Co-Chairs  also  informed  the  ADP  of  their 
request to the secretariat to cluster and enhance the visibility of side events and exhibits in 
Lima  that  were  directly  relevant  to  the  thematic  areas  explored  by  the  technical  expert 
meetings in 2014, and that further information on these events and exhibits was available 
on the UNFCCC website.12 

19.  At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the attention of delegates to the high-level 
ministerial  dialogue  on  climate  finance  and  the  high-level  ministerial  dialogue  on  the 
Durban  Platform  for  Enhanced  Action,  which  were  to  be  held  on  9  and  10  December, 
respectively.  They  expressed  their  appreciation  to  Mr.  Manuel  Pulgar-Vidal,  President  of 
COP 20 and the tenth session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the 
Parties to the Kyoto  Protocol (CMP), and his team  for the great efforts  made to facilitate 
the ADP process.

20. 
The  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to  attend  the  numerous  briefings,  forums  and 
events  on  areas  of  relevance  to  the  work  of  the  ADP  being  held  in  Lima  and  informed 
delegates that a list of these events was available on the UNFCCC website.13 

21.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  ADP  agreed  to  the  proposals  by  the  Co-Chairs  on  the 
organization of work by the ADP on item 3.  

22. 
The  ADP  met  on  6  December  to  take  stock  of  progress  made  and  to  consider  the 
possible way forward. Further to this informal meeting and in response to an invitation by 
the President of COP 20/CMP 10, on 8 December the Co-Chairs issued a revised version of 
the draft decision text referred to in paragraph 16 above and of the draft text containing the 
elements  for  a  draft  negotiating  text.  At  the  request  of  Parties,  a  compilation  of  textual 
inputs received from Parties14 was made available on the UNFCCC website.15 

23. 
Following the stocktaking meeting and the issuance of the draft texts referred to in 
paragraph  22  above,  the  ADP  further  focused  its  work,  including  through  line-by-line 
negotiations  on  the  draft  decision  text  on  agenda  item  3.  The  progress  of  this  work  was 
captured in: 

(a) 

A  revised  version  of  the  draft  text  containing  the  elements  for  a  draft 

negotiating text, issued on 10 December;  

(b) 

Revised  versions  of  the  draft  decision  text  on  agenda  item  3  reflecting  the 
status  of  the  negotiations,  made  available  on  the  UNFCCC  website  on  9,  10  and  11 
December.16 

24. 
Progress was also reflected in the oral reports by the ADP Co-Chairs to the informal 
stocktaking  plenaries  convened  by  the  President  of  COP 20/CMP 10  on  10,  11  and  12 
December. 

25. 
In  addition  to  the  consultations  with  Parties  undertaken  by  the  President  of 
COP 20/CMP  10  and  the  ongoing  ADP  negotiations,  on  12  December  the  President 
launched  ministerial  consultations  on  ADP  issues  facilitated  on  his  behalf  by  ministers 
Vivian Balakrishnan (Singapore) and Tine Sundtoft (Norway) with a view to facilitating a 
successful outcome of the ADP process. 

26.  On 13 December, the Co-Chairs convened an informal ADP meeting to introduce a 
further revised draft decision on agenda item 3 with an annex containing the elements for a 
draft negotiating text referred to in paragraph 23(a) above.17 

27.  On  the  same  day,  the  Co-Chairs  opened  the  14th  plenary  meeting  and  invited  the

I.  Opening of the session 

(Agenda item 1) 

1. 
The seventh part of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban 
Platform  for  Enhanced  Action  (ADP)  was  held  at  the  United  Nations  Climate  Change 
Conference, Lima, Peru, from 2 to 13 December 2014.1 

2. 
The  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP,  Mr.  Kishan  Kumarsingh  (non-Annex  I)  and  Mr. Artur 
Runge-Metzger (Annex I), resumed the second session and opened the 13th plenary meeting 
on 2 December. They welcomed all Parties and observers. They also welcomed Ms. Anna 
Serzysko (Annex I) as Rapporteur of the ADP.2 

3. 
The  Co-Chairs  stressed  the  need  for  the  ADP  to  provide  to  the  Conference  of  the 
Parties (COP) a clear and solid foundation for the new global climate change agreement to 
be  adopted  at  COP  21,  which  would  signal  to  the  world  the  determination  of  Parties  to 
deliver  a  successful  outcome  at  that  session  of  the  COP,  to  be  held  in  Paris,  France. The 
Co-Chairs reminded delegates of the need to identify the information that will be provided 
in relation to the intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) in accordance with 
decision 1/CP.19 and called for the strengthening and acceleration of climate action prior to 
2020 through a decision that was to be considered and adopted at COP 20. 

4. 
Statements  were  made  by  representatives  of  13  Parties,  including  on  behalf  of  the 
Group  of  77  and  China,  the  European  Union  and  its  28  member  States,  the  Umbrella 
Group, the Environmental Integrity Group, the African Group, the Alliance of Small Island 
States,  the  least  developed  countries  (LDCs),  the  Independent  Association  for  Latin 
America and the Caribbean (AILAC), the Central American Integration System, the League 
of  Arab  States,  the  BASIC  countries  (Brazil,  China,  India  and  South  Africa),  the  Like-
minded  Developing  Countries  and  the  Coalition  for  Rainforest  Nations.  In  addition, 
statements  were  made  on  behalf  of  environmental  non-governmental  organizations 
(NGOs), farmers NGOs, indigenous peoples organizations, local government and municipal 
authorities,  trade  union  NGOs,  women  and  gender  NGOs,  youth  NGOs  and  business  and 
industry NGOs.  

II.  Organizational matters 

(Agenda item 2) 

A.  Election of officers 
(Agenda item 2(a)) 

The  ADP  considered  this  sub-item  at  its  14th  meeting,  on  13  December.  The  Co-

B.  Adoption of the agenda 

(Agenda item 2(b)) 

The  agenda  for  the  second  session  of  the  ADP  was  adopted  by  the  ADP  at  the  1st 

7. 
meeting of the session, on 29 April 2013.3  

C.  Organization of the work of the session 

(Agenda item 2(c)) 

At  the  13th  meeting,  on  2  December,  the  Co-Chairs  drew  the  attention  of  the 
8. 
delegates to the scenario note prepared for the seventh part of the session,4 and outlined the 
arrangements made in the light of the organization of work previously agreed by the ADP, 
the  mandates  of  the  ADP,  including  those  given  at  COP  19,5  and  pre-sessional 
consultations.  The  organization  of  the  work  on  agenda  item  3  included  a  contact  group 
established at the fourth part of the session.6  

9. 
At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs stressed the importance of optimizing the use of 
the limited time available and informed the ADP of the greater efforts on time management 
undertaken  by  the  Chairs  of  the  subsidiary  bodies  in  consultation  with  the  Bureau  of  the 
COP and the negotiating groups to strengthen inclusivity, discipline, respect and fairness. 

In addition, the Co-Chairs informed Parties of their intention to hold a special event 

10. 
with observers during the session. This event took place on 5 December. 

III.  Implementation of all the elements of decision 1/CP.17 

(Agenda item 3) 

1.  Proceedings 

The ADP considered this item at its 13th meeting, as well as at its 14th meeting, on 
11. 
13  December.  It  had  before  it  documents  FCCC/ADP/2014/3,  FCCC/ADP/2014/L.4, 
FCCC/ADP/2014/L.5,  FCCC/ADP/2014/CRP.4  and  FCCC/2014/TP/13  and  Add.1–4,  as 
well as the informal notes prepared for the seventh part of the session.7 

12.  At the 13th meeting, the Co-Chairs recalled the establishment of the contact group on 
item 3, referred to in paragraph  8 above, and its  mandate  to  work in accordance  with the 
agreed  agenda  and  established  UNFCCC  practice.  They  also  recalled  the  core  principles 
guiding the work of the ADP, namely that the process will continue to be Party-driven and 
build  on  inputs  from  Parties,  and  that  any  outputs  of  the  process  will  reflect  inputs  from 
Parties.  

13.  At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the attention of delegates to the informal 
documents prepared by the Co-Chairs and aimed at supporting delegates by providing focus

to the negotiations and capturing the progress made by the ADP as well as the submissions 
received, namely: 

(a) 

A non-paper on elements for a draft negotiating text updating the earlier non-

paper;8 

(b)  A  draft  decision  text  on  advancing  the  Durban  Platform  for  Enhanced 

Action.9 

The  Co-Chairs  underlined  the  need  to  continue  the  consideration  and  further 
14. 
elaboration of the elements for a draft negotiating text with a view to making a negotiating 
text available before May 2015, in line with the  mandates contained in decisions 2/CP.18 
and  1/CP.19.  The  Co-Chairs  also  stressed  the  need  for  the  ADP  to  consider  how  to  take 
forward its work on the elements, and how to forward the results of this work to 2015.  

15. 
In  addition,  the  Co-Chairs  informed  the  ADP  of  the  calls  from  Parties  for  textual 
negotiations.  In  this  context,  the  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to  make  specific 
suggestions that seek to build bridges and clarify options so as to allow the contact group to 
collectively  advance  its  work  towards  a  draft  negotiating  text.  In  the  light  of  the  limited 
time  available  to  the  ADP  to  advance  this  work,  the  Co-Chairs  proposed  that  focused 
negotiations in the contact group on the elements for a draft negotiating text be undertaken 
in parallel and facilitated by either one of the Co-Chairs.  

16.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  recalled  the  work  undertaken  by  the  ADP  on 
draft decision texts on the identification of the information that Parties  will provide when 
putting forward their INDCs and on accelerating the implementation of enhanced pre-2020 
climate action. The Co-Chairs proposed that the contact group continue its work on these 
issues  through  textual  negotiations  with  a  view  to  agreeing  on  a  draft  decision  to  be 
recommended for consideration and adoption at COP 20.  

17. 
The Co-Chairs further drew the attention of delegates to the updated technical paper 
titled “Updated compilation of information on the mitigation benefits of actions, initiatives 
and options to enhance mitigation ambition”,10 prepared by the secretariat as requested by 
the  ADP  at  the  third  part  of  its  second  session.11  The  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to 
read  the  updated  technical  paper  and  to  bring  it  to  the  attention  of  the  relevant 
implementation officials in their respective governments.  

18. 
In  the  context  of  pre-2020  action,  the  Co-Chairs  also  informed  the  ADP  of  their 
request to the secretariat to cluster and enhance the visibility of side events and exhibits in 
Lima  that  were  directly  relevant  to  the  thematic  areas  explored  by  the  technical  expert 
meetings in 2014, and that further information on these events and exhibits was available 
on the UNFCCC website.12 

19.  At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the attention of delegates to the high-level 
ministerial  dialogue  on  climate  finance  and  the  high-level  ministerial  dialogue  on  the 
Durban  Platform  for  Enhanced  Action,  which  were  to  be  held  on  9  and  10  December, 
respectively.  They  expressed  their  appreciation  to  Mr.  Manuel  Pulgar-Vidal,  President  of 
COP 20 and the tenth session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the 
Parties to the Kyoto  Protocol (CMP), and his team  for the great efforts  made to facilitate 
the ADP process.

20. 
The  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to  attend  the  numerous  briefings,  forums  and 
events  on  areas  of  relevance  to  the  work  of  the  ADP  being  held  in  Lima  and  informed 
delegates that a list of these events was available on the UNFCCC website.13 

21.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  ADP  agreed  to  the  proposals  by  the  Co-Chairs  on  the 
organization of work by the ADP on item 3.  

22. 
The  ADP  met  on  6  December  to  take  stock  of  progress  made  and  to  consider  the 
possible way forward. Further to this informal meeting and in response to an invitation by 
the President of COP 20/CMP 10, on 8 December the Co-Chairs issued a revised version of 
the draft decision text referred to in paragraph 16 above and of the draft text containing the 
elements  for  a  draft  negotiating  text.  At  the  request  of  Parties,  a  compilation  of  textual 
inputs received from Parties14 was made available on the UNFCCC website.15 

23. 
Following the stocktaking meeting and the issuance of the draft texts referred to in 
paragraph  22  above,  the  ADP  further  focused  its  work,  including  through  line-by-line 
negotiations  on  the  draft  decision  text  on  agenda  item  3.  The  progress  of  this  work  was 
captured in: 

(a) 

A  revised  version  of  the  draft  text  containing  the  elements  for  a  draft 

negotiating text, issued on 10 December;  

(b) 

Revised  versions  of  the  draft  decision  text  on  agenda  item  3  reflecting  the 
status  of  the  negotiations,  made  available  on  the  UNFCCC  website  on  9,  10  and  11 
December.16 

24. 
Progress was also reflected in the oral reports by the ADP Co-Chairs to the informal 
stocktaking  plenaries  convened  by  the  President  of  COP 20/CMP 10  on  10,  11  and  12 
December. 

25. 
In  addition  to  the  consultations  with  Parties  undertaken  by  the  President  of 
COP 20/CMP  10  and  the  ongoing  ADP  negotiations,  on  12  December  the  President 
launched  ministerial  consultations  on  ADP  issues  facilitated  on  his  behalf  by  ministers 
Vivian Balakrishnan (Singapore) and Tine Sundtoft (Norway) with a view to facilitating a 
successful outcome of the ADP process. 

26.  On 13 December, the Co-Chairs convened an informal ADP meeting to introduce a 
further revised draft decision on agenda item 3 with an annex containing the elements for a 
draft negotiating text referred to in paragraph 23(a) above.17 

27.  On  the  same  day,  the  Co-Chairs  opened  the  14th  plenary  meeting  and  invited  the 
ADP to consider the draft decision referred to in paragraph 26 above.  

28.  At  the  beginning  of  the  meeting,  the  President  of  COP 20/CMP 10  recalled  the 
expectations for a successful outcome of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in 
Lima,  which  would  provide  a  solid  foundation  for  reaching  an  agreement  in  Paris.  The 
President  called  for  flexibility  and  encouraged  Parties  to  work  together  to  achieve  the 
successful outcome needed.  

29. 
Statements  were  made  by  representatives  of  41  Parties,  including  on  behalf  of  the 
Environmental Integrity Group, the African Group, the European Union and its 28 member 
States,  the  LDCs,  AILAC,  the  Like-minded  Developing  Countries,  the  League  of  Arab 
States and the BASIC countries.

I.  Opening of the session 

(Agenda item 1) 

1. 
The seventh part of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban 
Platform  for  Enhanced  Action  (ADP)  was  held  at  the  United  Nations  Climate  Change 
Conference, Lima, Peru, from 2 to 13 December 2014.1 

2. 
The  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP,  Mr.  Kishan  Kumarsingh  (non-Annex  I)  and  Mr. Artur 
Runge-Metzger (Annex I), resumed the second session and opened the 13th plenary meeting 
on 2 December. They welcomed all Parties and observers. They also welcomed Ms. Anna 
Serzysko (Annex I) as Rapporteur of the ADP.2 

3. 
The  Co-Chairs  stressed  the  need  for  the  ADP  to  provide  to  the  Conference  of  the 
Parties (COP) a clear and solid foundation for the new global climate change agreement to 
be  adopted  at  COP  21,  which  would  signal  to  the  world  the  determination  of  Parties  to 
deliver  a  successful  outcome  at  that  session  of  the  COP,  to  be  held  in  Paris,  France. The 
Co-Chairs reminded delegates of the need to identify the information that will be provided 
in relation to the intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) in accordance with 
decision 1/CP.19 and called for the strengthening and acceleration of climate action prior to 
2020 through a decision that was to be considered and adopted at COP 20. 

4. 
Statements  were  made  by  representatives  of  13  Parties,  including  on  behalf  of  the 
Group  of  77  and  China,  the  European  Union  and  its  28  member  States,  the  Umbrella 
Group, the Environmental Integrity Group, the African Group, the Alliance of Small Island 
States,  the  least  developed  countries  (LDCs),  the  Independent  Association  for  Latin 
America and the Caribbean (AILAC), the Central American Integration System, the League 
of  Arab  States,  the  BASIC  countries  (Brazil,  China,  India  and  South  Africa),  the  Like-
minded  Developing  Countries  and  the  Coalition  for  Rainforest  Nations.  In  addition, 
statements  were  made  on  behalf  of  environmental  non-governmental  organizations 
(NGOs), farmers NGOs, indigenous peoples organizations, local government and municipal 
authorities,  trade  union  NGOs,  women  and  gender  NGOs,  youth  NGOs  and  business  and 
industry NGOs.  

II.  Organizational matters 

(Agenda item 2) 

A.  Election of officers 
(Agenda item 2(a)) 

The  ADP  considered  this  sub-item  at  its  14th  meeting,  on  13  December.  The  Co-
5. 
Chairs reported that the consultations on the  election of the  Bureau of the  ADP had been 
successfully concluded.  

1  The report on the first and second parts of the second session of the ADP is contained in document

current members of its Bureau at the second and third parts of its second session, as reflected in 
documents FCCC/ADP/2013/2, paragraph 6, and FCCC/ADP/2013/3, paragraph 5, respectively.

6. 
On  a  proposal  of  the  Co-Chairs,  the  ADP  elected  by  acclamation  Mr.  Ahmed 
Djoghlaf  (non-Annex  I)  and  Mr.  Daniel  Reifsnyder  (Annex  I)  as  its  Co-Chairs  and  Ms. 
Yang Liu (non-Annex I) as its Rapporteur. 

B.  Adoption of the agenda 

(Agenda item 2(b)) 

The  agenda  for  the  second  session  of  the  ADP  was  adopted  by  the  ADP  at  the  1st 

7. 
meeting of the session, on 29 April 2013.3  

C.  Organization of the work of the session 

(Agenda item 2(c)) 

At  the  13th  meeting,  on  2  December,  the  Co-Chairs  drew  the  attention  of  the 
8. 
delegates to the scenario note prepared for the seventh part of the session,4 and outlined the 
arrangements made in the light of the organization of work previously agreed by the ADP, 
the  mandates  of  the  ADP,  including  those  given  at  COP  19,5  and  pre-sessional 
consultations.  The  organization  of  the  work  on  agenda  item  3  included  a  contact  group 
established at the fourth part of the session.6  

9. 
At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs stressed the importance of optimizing the use of 
the limited time available and informed the ADP of the greater efforts on time management 
undertaken  by  the  Chairs  of  the  subsidiary  bodies  in  consultation  with  the  Bureau  of  the 
COP and the negotiating groups to strengthen inclusivity, discipline, respect and fairness. 

In addition, the Co-Chairs informed Parties of their intention to hold a special event 

10. 
with observers during the session. This event took place on 5 December. 

III.  Implementation of all the elements of decision 1/CP.17 

(Agenda item 3) 

1.  Proceedings 

The ADP considered this item at its 13th meeting, as well as at its 14th meeting, on 
11. 
13  December.  It  had  before  it  documents  FCCC/ADP/2014/3,  FCCC/ADP/2014/L.4, 
FCCC/ADP/2014/L.5,  FCCC/ADP/2014/CRP.4  and  FCCC/2014/TP/13  and  Add.1–4,  as 
well as the informal notes prepared for the seventh part of the session.7 

12.  At the 13th meeting, the Co-Chairs recalled the establishment of the contact group on 
item 3, referred to in paragraph  8 above, and its  mandate  to  work in accordance  with the 
agreed  agenda  and  established  UNFCCC  practice.  They  also  recalled  the  core  principles 
guiding the work of the ADP, namely that the process will continue to be Party-driven and 
build  on  inputs  from  Parties,  and  that  any  outputs  of  the  process  will  reflect  inputs  from 
Parties.  

13.  At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the attention of delegates to the informal 
documents prepared by the Co-Chairs and aimed at supporting delegates by providing focus

to the negotiations and capturing the progress made by the ADP as well as the submissions 
received, namely: 

(a) 

A non-paper on elements for a draft negotiating text updating the earlier non-

paper;8 

(b)  A  draft  decision  text  on  advancing  the  Durban  Platform  for  Enhanced 

Action.9 

The  Co-Chairs  underlined  the  need  to  continue  the  consideration  and  further 
14. 
elaboration of the elements for a draft negotiating text with a view to making a negotiating 
text available before May 2015, in line with the  mandates contained in decisions 2/CP.18 
and  1/CP.19.  The  Co-Chairs  also  stressed  the  need  for  the  ADP  to  consider  how  to  take 
forward its work on the elements, and how to forward the results of this work to 2015.  

15. 
In  addition,  the  Co-Chairs  informed  the  ADP  of  the  calls  from  Parties  for  textual 
negotiations.  In  this  context,  the  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to  make  specific 
suggestions that seek to build bridges and clarify options so as to allow the contact group to 
collectively  advance  its  work  towards  a  draft  negotiating  text.  In  the  light  of  the  limited 
time  available  to  the  ADP  to  advance  this  work,  the  Co-Chairs  proposed  that  focused 
negotiations in the contact group on the elements for a draft negotiating text be undertaken 
in parallel and facilitated by either one of the Co-Chairs.  

16.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  recalled  the  work  undertaken  by  the  ADP  on 
draft decision texts on the identification of the information that Parties  will provide when 
putting forward their INDCs and on accelerating the implementation of enhanced pre-2020 
climate action. The Co-Chairs proposed that the contact group continue its work on these 
issues  through  textual  negotiations  with  a  view  to  agreeing  on  a  draft  decision  to  be 
recommended for consideration and adoption at COP 20.  

17. 
The Co-Chairs further drew the attention of delegates to the updated technical paper 
titled “Updated compilation of information on the mitigation benefits of actions, initiatives 
and options to enhance mitigation ambition”,10 prepared by the secretariat as requested by 
the  ADP  at  the  third  part  of  its  second  session.11  The  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to 
read  the  updated  technical  paper  and  to  bring  it  to  the  attention  of  the  relevant 
implementation officials in their respective governments.  

18. 
In  the  context  of  pre-2020  action,  the  Co-Chairs  also  informed  the  ADP  of  their 
request to the secretariat to cluster and enhance the visibility of side events and exhibits in 
Lima  that  were  directly  relevant  to  the  thematic  areas  explored  by  the  technical  expert 
meetings in 2014, and that further information on these events and exhibits was available 
on the UNFCCC website.12 

19.  At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the attention of delegates to the high-level 
ministerial  dialogue  on  climate  finance  and  the  high-level  ministerial  dialogue  on  the 
Durban  Platform  for  Enhanced  Action,  which  were  to  be  held  on  9  and  10  December, 
respectively.  They  expressed  their  appreciation  to  Mr.  Manuel  Pulgar-Vidal,  President  of 
COP 20 and the tenth session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the 
Parties to the Kyoto  Protocol (CMP), and his team  for the great efforts  made to facilitate 
the ADP process.

20. 
The  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to  attend  the  numerous  briefings,  forums  and 
events  on  areas  of  relevance  to  the  work  of  the  ADP  being  held  in  Lima  and  informed 
delegates that a list of these events was available on the UNFCCC website.13 

21.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  ADP  agreed  to  the  proposals  by  the  Co-Chairs  on  the 
organization of work by the ADP on item 3.  

22. 
The  ADP  met  on  6  December  to  take  stock  of  progress  made  and  to  consider  the 
possible way forward. Further to this informal meeting and in response to an invitation by 
the President of COP 20/CMP 10, on 8 December the Co-Chairs issued a revised version of 
the draft decision text referred to in paragraph 16 above and of the draft text containing the 
elements  for  a  draft  negotiating  text.  At  the  request  of  Parties,  a  compilation  of  textual 
inputs received from Parties14 was made available on the UNFCCC website.15 

23. 
Following the stocktaking meeting and the issuance of the draft texts referred to in 
paragraph  22  above,  the  ADP  further  focused  its  work,  including  through  line-by-line 
negotiations  on  the  draft  decision  text  on  agenda  item  3.  The  progress  of  this  work  was 
captured in: 

(a) 

A  revised  version  of  the  draft  text  containing  the  elements  for  a  draft 

negotiating text, issued on 10 December;  

(b) 

Revised  versions  of  the  draft  decision  text  on  agenda  item  3  reflecting  the 
status  of  the  negotiations,  made  available  on  the  UNFCCC  website  on  9,  10  and  11 
December.16 

24. 
Progress was also reflected in the oral reports by the ADP Co-Chairs to the informal 
stocktaking  plenaries  convened  by  the  President  of  COP 20/CMP 10  on  10,  11  and  12 
December. 

25. 
In  addition  to  the  consultations  with  Parties  undertaken  by  the  President  of 
COP 20/CMP  10  and  the  ongoing  ADP  negotiations,  on  12  December  the  President 
launched  ministerial  consultations  on  ADP  issues  facilitated  on  his  behalf  by  ministers 
Vivian Balakrishnan (Singapore) and Tine Sundtoft (Norway) with a view to facilitating a 
successful outcome of the ADP process. 

26.  On 13 December, the Co-Chairs convened an informal ADP meeting to introduce a 
further revised draft decision on agenda item 3 with an annex containing the elements for a 
draft negotiating text referred to in paragraph 23(a) above.17 

27.  On  the  same  day,  the  Co-Chairs  opened  the  14th  plenary  meeting  and  invited  the 
ADP to consider the draft decision referred to in paragraph 26 above.  

28.  At  the  beginning  of  the  meeting,  the  President  of  COP 20/CMP 10  recalled  the 
expectations for a successful outcome of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in 
Lima,  which  would  provide  a  solid  foundation  for  reaching  an  agreement  in  Paris.  The 
President  called  for  flexibility  and  encouraged  Parties  to  work  together  to  achieve  the 
successful outcome needed.  

29. 
Statements  were  made  by  representatives  of  41  Parties,  including  on  behalf  of  the 
Environmental Integrity Group, the African Group, the European Union and its 28 member 
States,  the  LDCs,  AILAC,  the  Like-minded  Developing  Countries,  the  League  of  Arab 
States and the BASIC countries.

I.  Opening of the session 

(Agenda item 1) 

1. 
The seventh part of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban 
Platform  for  Enhanced  Action  (ADP)  was  held  at  the  United  Nations  Climate  Change 
Conference, Lima, Peru, from 2 to 13 December 2014.1 

2. 
The  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP,  Mr.  Kishan  Kumarsingh  (non-Annex  I)  and  Mr. Artur 
Runge-Metzger (Annex I), resumed the second session and opened the 13th plenary meeting 
on 2 December. They welcomed all Parties and observers. They also welcomed Ms. Anna 
Serzysko (Annex I) as Rapporteur of the ADP.2 

3. 
The  Co-Chairs  stressed  the  need  for  the  ADP  to  provide  to  the  Conference  of  the 
Parties (COP) a clear and solid foundation for the new global climate change agreement to 
be  adopted  at  COP  21,  which  would  signal  to  the  world  the  determination  of  Parties  to 
deliver  a  successful  outcome  at  that  session  of  the  COP,  to  be  held  in  Paris,  France. The 
Co-Chairs reminded delegates of the need to identify the information that will be provided 
in relation to the intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) in accordance with 
decision 1/CP.19 and called for the strengthening and acceleration of climate action prior to 
2020 through a decision that was to be considered and adopted at COP 20. 

4. 
Statements  were  made  by  representatives  of  13  Parties,  including  on  behalf  of  the 
Group  of  77  and  China,  the  European  Union  and  its  28  member  States,  the  Umbrella 
Group, the Environmental Integrity Group, the African Group, the Alliance of Small Island 
States,  the  least  developed  countries  (LDCs),  the  Independent  Association  for  Latin 
America and the Caribbean (AILAC), the Central American Integration System, the League 
of  Arab  States,  the  BASIC  countries  (Brazil,  China,  India  and  South  Africa),  the  Like-
minded  Developing  Countries  and  the  Coalition  for  Rainforest  Nations.  In  addition, 
statements  were  made  on  behalf  of  environmental  non-governmental  organizations 
(NGOs), farmers NGOs, indigenous peoples organizations, local government and municipal 
authorities,  trade  union  NGOs,  women  and  gender  NGOs,  youth  NGOs  and  business  and 
industry NGOs.  

II.  Organizational matters

B.  Adoption of the agenda 

(Agenda item 2(b)) 

The  agenda  for  the  second  session  of  the  ADP  was  adopted  by  the  ADP  at  the  1st 

7. 
meeting of the session, on 29 April 2013.3  

C.  Organization of the work of the session 

(Agenda item 2(c)) 

At  the  13th  meeting,  on  2  December,  the  Co-Chairs  drew  the  attention  of  the 
8. 
delegates to the scenario note prepared for the seventh part of the session,4 and outlined the 
arrangements made in the light of the organization of work previously agreed by the ADP, 
the  mandates  of  the  ADP,  including  those  given  at  COP  19,5  and  pre-sessional 
consultations.  The  organization  of  the  work  on  agenda  item  3  included  a  contact  group 
established at the fourth part of the session.6  

9. 
At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs stressed the importance of optimizing the use of 
the limited time available and informed the ADP of the greater efforts on time management 
undertaken  by  the  Chairs  of  the  subsidiary  bodies  in  consultation  with  the  Bureau  of  the 
COP and the negotiating groups to strengthen inclusivity, discipline, respect and fairness. 

In addition, the Co-Chairs informed Parties of their intention to hold a special event 

10. 
with observers during the session. This event took place on 5 December. 

III.  Implementation of all the elements of decision 1/CP.17 

(Agenda item 3) 

1.  Proceedings 

The ADP considered this item at its 13th meeting, as well as at its 14th meeting, on 
11. 
13  December.  It  had  before  it  documents  FCCC/ADP/2014/3,  FCCC/ADP/2014/L.4, 
FCCC/ADP/2014/L.5,  FCCC/ADP/2014/CRP.4  and  FCCC/2014/TP/13  and  Add.1–4,  as 
well as the informal notes prepared for the seventh part of the session.7 

12.  At the 13th meeting, the Co-Chairs recalled the establishment of the contact group on 
item 3, referred to in paragraph  8 above, and its  mandate  to  work in accordance  with the 
agreed  agenda  and  established  UNFCCC  practice.  They  also  recalled  the  core  principles 
guiding the work of the ADP, namely that the process will continue to be Party-driven and 
build  on  inputs  from  Parties,  and  that  any  outputs  of  the  process  will  reflect  inputs  from 
Parties.  

13.  At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the attention of delegates to the informal 
documents prepared by the Co-Chairs and aimed at supporting delegates by providing focus

to the negotiations and capturing the progress made by the ADP as well as the submissions 
received, namely: 

(a) 

A non-paper on elements for a draft negotiating text updating the earlier non-

paper;8 

(b)  A  draft  decision  text  on  advancing  the  Durban  Platform  for  Enhanced 

Action.9 

The  Co-Chairs  underlined  the  need  to  continue  the  consideration  and  further 
14. 
elaboration of the elements for a draft negotiating text with a view to making a negotiating 
text available before May 2015, in line with the  mandates contained in decisions 2/CP.18 
and  1/CP.19.  The  Co-Chairs  also  stressed  the  need  for  the  ADP  to  consider  how  to  take 
forward its work on the elements, and how to forward the results of this work to 2015.  

15. 
In  addition,  the  Co-Chairs  informed  the  ADP  of  the  calls  from  Parties  for  textual 
negotiations.  In  this  context,  the  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to  make  specific 
suggestions that seek to build bridges and clarify options so as to allow the contact group to 
collectively  advance  its  work  towards  a  draft  negotiating  text.  In  the  light  of  the  limited 
time  available  to  the  ADP  to  advance  this  work,  the  Co-Chairs  proposed  that  focused 
negotiations in the contact group on the elements for a draft negotiating text be undertaken 
in parallel and facilitated by either one of the Co-Chairs.  

16.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  recalled  the  work  undertaken  by  the  ADP  on 
draft decision texts on the identification of the information that Parties  will provide when 
putting forward their INDCs and on accelerating the implementation of enhanced pre-2020 
climate action. The Co-Chairs proposed that the contact group continue its work on these 
issues  through  textual  negotiations  with  a  view  to  agreeing  on  a  draft  decision  to  be 
recommended for consideration and adoption at COP 20.  

17. 
The Co-Chairs further drew the attention of delegates to the updated technical paper 
titled “Updated compilation of information on the mitigation benefits of actions, initiatives 
and options to enhance mitigation ambition”,10 prepared by the secretariat as requested by 
the  ADP  at  the  third  part  of  its  second  session.11  The  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to 
read  the  updated  technical  paper  and  to  bring  it  to  the  attention  of  the  relevant 
implementation officials in their respective governments.  

18. 
In  the  context  of  pre-2020  action,  the  Co-Chairs  also  informed  the  ADP  of  their 
request to the secretariat to cluster and enhance the visibility of side events and exhibits in 
Lima  that  were  directly  relevant  to  the  thematic  areas  explored  by  the  technical  expert 
meetings in 2014, and that further information on these events and exhibits was available 
on the UNFCCC website.12 

19.  At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the attention of delegates to the high-level 
ministerial  dialogue  on  climate  finance  and  the  high-level  ministerial  dialogue  on  the 
Durban  Platform  for  Enhanced  Action,  which  were  to  be  held  on  9  and  10  December, 
respectively.  They  expressed  their  appreciation  to  Mr.  Manuel  Pulgar-Vidal,  President  of 
COP 20 and the tenth session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the 
Parties to the Kyoto  Protocol (CMP), and his team  for the great efforts  made to facilitate 
the ADP process.

20. 
The  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to  attend  the  numerous  briefings,  forums  and 
events  on  areas  of  relevance  to  the  work  of  the  ADP  being  held  in  Lima  and  informed 
delegates that a list of these events was available on the UNFCCC website.13 

21.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  ADP  agreed  to  the  proposals  by  the  Co-Chairs  on  the 
organization of work by the ADP on item 3.  

22. 
The  ADP  met  on  6  December  to  take  stock  of  progress  made  and  to  consider  the 
possible way forward. Further to this informal meeting and in response to an invitation by 
the President of COP 20/CMP 10, on 8 December the Co-Chairs issued a revised version of 
the draft decision text referred to in paragraph 16 above and of the draft text containing the 
elements  for  a  draft  negotiating  text.  At  the  request  of  Parties,  a  compilation  of  textual 
inputs received from Parties14 was made available on the UNFCCC website.15 

23. 
Following the stocktaking meeting and the issuance of the draft texts referred to in 
paragraph  22  above,  the  ADP  further  focused  its  work,  including  through  line-by-line 
negotiations  on  the  draft  decision  text  on  agenda  item  3.  The  progress  of  this  work  was 
captured in: 

(a) 

A  revised  version  of  the  draft  text  containing  the  elements  for  a  draft 

negotiating text, issued on 10 December;  

(b) 

Revised  versions  of  the  draft  decision  text  on  agenda  item  3  reflecting  the 
status  of  the  negotiations,  made  available  on  the  UNFCCC  website  on  9,  10  and  11 
December.16 

24. 
Progress was also reflected in the oral reports by the ADP Co-Chairs to the informal 
stocktaking  plenaries  convened  by  the  President  of  COP 20/CMP 10  on  10,  11  and  12 
December. 

25. 
In  addition  to  the  consultations  with  Parties  undertaken  by  the  President  of 
COP 20/CMP  10  and  the  ongoing  ADP  negotiations,  on  12  December  the  President 
launched  ministerial  consultations  on  ADP  issues  facilitated  on  his  behalf  by  ministers 
Vivian Balakrishnan (Singapore) and Tine Sundtoft (Norway) with a view to facilitating a 
successful outcome of the ADP process. 

26.  On 13 December, the Co-Chairs convened an informal ADP meeting to introduce a 
further revised draft decision on agenda item 3 with an annex containing the elements for a 
draft negotiating text referred to in paragraph 23(a) above.17 

27.  On  the  same  day,  the  Co-Chairs  opened  the  14th  plenary  meeting  and  invited  the 
ADP to consider the draft decision referred to in paragraph 26 above.  

28.  At  the  beginning  of  the  meeting,  the  President  of  COP 20/CMP 10  recalled  the 
expectations for a successful outcome of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in 
Lima,  which  would  provide  a  solid  foundation  for  reaching  an  agreement  in  Paris.  The 
President  called  for  flexibility  and  encouraged  Parties  to  work  together  to  achieve  the 
successful outcome needed.  

29. 
Statements  were  made  by  representatives  of  41  Parties,  including  on  behalf  of  the 
Environmental Integrity Group, the African Group, the European Union and its 28 member 
States,  the  LDCs,  AILAC,  the  Like-minded  Developing  Countries,  the  League  of  Arab 
States and the BASIC countries.

I.  Opening of the session 

(Agenda item 1) 

1. 
The seventh part of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban 
Platform  for  Enhanced  Action  (ADP)  was  held  at  the  United  Nations  Climate  Change 
Conference, Lima, Peru, from 2 to 13 December 2014.1 

2. 
The  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP,  Mr.  Kishan  Kumarsingh  (non-Annex  I)  and  Mr. Artur 
Runge-Metzger (Annex I), resumed the second session and opened the 13th plenary meeting 
on 2 December. They welcomed all Parties and observers. They also welcomed Ms. Anna 
Serzysko (Annex I) as Rapporteur of the ADP.2 

3. 
The  Co-Chairs  stressed  the  need  for  the  ADP  to  provide  to  the  Conference  of  the 
Parties (COP) a clear and solid foundation for the new global climate change agreement to 
be  adopted  at  COP  21,  which  would  signal  to  the  world  the  determination  of  Parties  to 
deliver  a  successful  outcome  at  that  session  of  the  COP,  to  be  held  in  Paris,  France. The 
Co-Chairs reminded delegates of the need to identify the information that will be provided 
in relation to the intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) in accordance with 
decision 1/CP.19 and called for the strengthening and acceleration of climate action prior to 
2020 through a decision that was to be considered and adopted at COP 20.

COP and the negotiating groups to strengthen inclusivity, discipline, respect and fairness. 

In addition, the Co-Chairs informed Parties of their intention to hold a special event 

10. 
with observers during the session. This event took place on 5 December. 

III.  Implementation of all the elements of decision 1/CP.17 

(Agenda item 3) 

1.  Proceedings 

The ADP considered this item at its 13th meeting, as well as at its 14th meeting, on 
11. 
13  December.  It  had  before  it  documents  FCCC/ADP/2014/3,  FCCC/ADP/2014/L.4, 
FCCC/ADP/2014/L.5,  FCCC/ADP/2014/CRP.4  and  FCCC/2014/TP/13  and  Add.1–4,  as 
well as the informal notes prepared for the seventh part of the session.7 

12.  At the 13th meeting, the Co-Chairs recalled the establishment of the contact group on 
item 3, referred to in paragraph  8 above, and its  mandate  to  work in accordance  with the 
agreed  agenda  and  established  UNFCCC  practice.  They  also  recalled  the  core  principles 
guiding the work of the ADP, namely that the process will continue to be Party-driven and 
build  on  inputs  from  Parties,  and  that  any  outputs  of  the  process  will  reflect  inputs  from 
Parties.  

13.  At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the attention of delegates to the informal 
documents prepared by the Co-Chairs and aimed at supporting delegates by providing focus

to the negotiations and capturing the progress made by the ADP as well as the submissions 
received, namely: 

(a) 

A non-paper on elements for a draft negotiating text updating the earlier non-

paper;8 

(b)  A  draft  decision  text  on  advancing  the  Durban  Platform  for  Enhanced 

Action.9 

The  Co-Chairs  underlined  the  need  to  continue  the  consideration  and  further 
14. 
elaboration of the elements for a draft negotiating text with a view to making a negotiating 
text available before May 2015, in line with the  mandates contained in decisions 2/CP.18 
and  1/CP.19.  The  Co-Chairs  also  stressed  the  need  for  the  ADP  to  consider  how  to  take 
forward its work on the elements, and how to forward the results of this work to 2015.  

15. 
In  addition,  the  Co-Chairs  informed  the  ADP  of  the  calls  from  Parties  for  textual 
negotiations.  In  this  context,  the  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to  make  specific 
suggestions that seek to build bridges and clarify options so as to allow the contact group to 
collectively  advance  its  work  towards  a  draft  negotiating  text.  In  the  light  of  the  limited 
time  available  to  the  ADP  to  advance  this  work,  the  Co-Chairs  proposed  that  focused 
negotiations in the contact group on the elements for a draft negotiating text be undertaken 
in parallel and facilitated by either one of the Co-Chairs.  

16.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  recalled  the  work  undertaken  by  the  ADP  on 
draft decision texts on the identification of the information that Parties  will provide when 
putting forward their INDCs and on accelerating the implementation of enhanced pre-2020 
climate action. The Co-Chairs proposed that the contact group continue its work on these 
issues  through  textual  negotiations  with  a  view  to  agreeing  on  a  draft  decision  to  be 
recommended for consideration and adoption at COP 20.  

17. 
The Co-Chairs further drew the attention of delegates to the updated technical paper 
titled “Updated compilation of information on the mitigation benefits of actions, initiatives 
and options to enhance mitigation ambition”,10 prepared by the secretariat as requested by 
the  ADP  at  the  third  part  of  its  second  session.11  The  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to 
read  the  updated  technical  paper  and  to  bring  it  to  the  attention  of  the  relevant 
implementation officials in their respective governments.  

18. 
In  the  context  of  pre-2020  action,  the  Co-Chairs  also  informed  the  ADP  of  their 
request to the secretariat to cluster and enhance the visibility of side events and exhibits in 
Lima  that  were  directly  relevant  to  the  thematic  areas  explored  by  the  technical  expert 
meetings in 2014, and that further information on these events and exhibits was available 
on the UNFCCC website.12 

19.  At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the attention of delegates to the high-level 
ministerial  dialogue  on  climate  finance  and  the  high-level  ministerial  dialogue  on  the 
Durban  Platform  for  Enhanced  Action,  which  were  to  be  held  on  9  and  10  December, 
respectively.  They  expressed  their  appreciation  to  Mr.  Manuel  Pulgar-Vidal,  President  of 
COP 20 and the tenth session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the 
Parties to the Kyoto  Protocol (CMP), and his team  for the great efforts  made to facilitate 
the ADP process.

20. 
The  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to  attend  the  numerous  briefings,  forums  and 
events  on  areas  of  relevance  to  the  work  of  the  ADP  being  held  in  Lima  and  informed 
delegates that a list of these events was available on the UNFCCC website.13 

21.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  ADP  agreed  to  the  proposals  by  the  Co-Chairs  on  the 
organization of work by the ADP on item 3.  

22. 
The  ADP  met  on  6  December  to  take  stock  of  progress  made  and  to  consider  the 
possible way forward. Further to this informal meeting and in response to an invitation by 
the President of COP 20/CMP 10, on 8 December the Co-Chairs issued a revised version of 
the draft decision text referred to in paragraph 16 above and of the draft text containing the 
elements  for  a  draft  negotiating  text.  At  the  request  of  Parties,  a  compilation  of  textual 
inputs received from Parties14 was made available on the UNFCCC website.15 

23. 
Following the stocktaking meeting and the issuance of the draft texts referred to in 
paragraph  22  above,  the  ADP  further  focused  its  work,  including  through  line-by-line 
negotiations  on  the  draft  decision  text  on  agenda  item  3.  The  progress  of  this  work  was 
captured in: 

(a) 

A  revised  version  of  the  draft  text  containing  the  elements  for  a  draft 

negotiating text, issued on 10 December;  

(b) 

Revised  versions  of  the  draft  decision  text  on  agenda  item  3  reflecting  the 
status  of  the  negotiations,  made  available  on  the  UNFCCC  website  on  9,  10  and  11 
December.16 

24. 
Progress was also reflected in the oral reports by the ADP Co-Chairs to the informal 
stocktaking  plenaries  convened  by  the  President  of  COP 20/CMP 10  on  10,  11  and  12 
December. 

25. 
In  addition  to  the  consultations  with  Parties  undertaken  by  the  President  of 
COP 20/CMP  10  and  the  ongoing  ADP  negotiations,  on  12  December  the  President 
launched  ministerial  consultations  on  ADP  issues  facilitated  on  his  behalf  by  ministers 
Vivian Balakrishnan (Singapore) and Tine Sundtoft (Norway) with a view to facilitating a 
successful outcome of the ADP process. 

26.  On 13 December, the Co-Chairs convened an informal ADP meeting to introduce a 
further revised draft decision on agenda item 3 with an annex containing the elements for a 
draft negotiating text referred to in paragraph 23(a) above.17 

27.  On  the  same  day,  the  Co-Chairs  opened  the  14th  plenary  meeting  and  invited  the 
ADP to consider the draft decision referred to in paragraph 26 above.  

28.  At  the  beginning  of  the  meeting,  the  President  of  COP 20/CMP 10  recalled  the 
expectations for a successful outcome of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in 
Lima,  which  would  provide  a  solid  foundation  for  reaching  an  agreement  in  Paris.  The 
President  called  for  flexibility  and  encouraged  Parties  to  work  together  to  achieve  the 
successful outcome needed.  

29. 
Statements  were  made  by  representatives  of  41  Parties,  including  on  behalf  of  the 
Environmental Integrity Group, the African Group, the European Union and its 28 member 
States,  the  LDCs,  AILAC,  the  Like-minded  Developing  Countries,  the  League  of  Arab 
States and the BASIC countries.

I.  Opening of the session 

(Agenda item 1)

Conference, Lima, Peru, from 2 to 13 December 2014.1 

2. 
The  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP,  Mr.  Kishan  Kumarsingh  (non-Annex  I)  and  Mr. Artur

deliver  a  successful  outcome  at  that  session  of  the  COP,  to  be  held  in  Paris,  France. The 
Co-Chairs reminded delegates of the need to identify the information that will be provided 
in relation to the intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) in accordance with

C.  Organization of the work of the session 

(Agenda item 2(c)) 

At  the  13th  meeting,  on  2  December,  the  Co-Chairs  drew  the  attention  of  the 
8. 
delegates to the scenario note prepared for the seventh part of the session,4 and outlined the 
arrangements made in the light of the organization of work previously agreed by the ADP, 
the  mandates  of  the  ADP,  including  those  given  at  COP  19,5  and  pre-sessional 
consultations.  The  organization  of  the  work  on  agenda  item  3  included  a  contact  group 
established at the fourth part of the session.6  

9. 
At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs stressed the importance of optimizing the use of 
the limited time available and informed the ADP of the greater efforts on time management 
undertaken  by  the  Chairs  of  the  subsidiary  bodies  in  consultation  with  the  Bureau  of  the 
COP and the negotiating groups to strengthen inclusivity, discipline, respect and fairness. 

In addition, the Co-Chairs informed Parties of their intention to hold a special event 

10. 
with observers during the session. This event took place on 5 December. 

III.  Implementation of all the elements of decision 1/CP.17 

(Agenda item 3) 

1.  Proceedings 

The ADP considered this item at its 13th meeting, as well as at its 14th meeting, on 
11. 
13  December.  It  had  before  it  documents  FCCC/ADP/2014/3,  FCCC/ADP/2014/L.4, 
FCCC/ADP/2014/L.5,  FCCC/ADP/2014/CRP.4  and  FCCC/2014/TP/13  and  Add.1–4,  as 
well as the informal notes prepared for the seventh part of the session.7 

12.  At the 13th meeting, the Co-Chairs recalled the establishment of the contact group on 
item 3, referred to in paragraph  8 above, and its  mandate  to  work in accordance  with the 
agreed  agenda  and  established  UNFCCC  practice.  They  also  recalled  the  core  principles 
guiding the work of the ADP, namely that the process will continue to be Party-driven and 
build  on  inputs  from  Parties,  and  that  any  outputs  of  the  process  will  reflect  inputs  from 
Parties.  

13.  At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the attention of delegates to the informal 
documents prepared by the Co-Chairs and aimed at supporting delegates by providing focus

to the negotiations and capturing the progress made by the ADP as well as the submissions 
received, namely: 

(a) 

A non-paper on elements for a draft negotiating text updating the earlier non-

paper;8 

(b)  A  draft  decision  text  on  advancing  the  Durban  Platform  for  Enhanced 

Action.9 

The  Co-Chairs  underlined  the  need  to  continue  the  consideration  and  further 
14. 
elaboration of the elements for a draft negotiating text with a view to making a negotiating 
text available before May 2015, in line with the  mandates contained in decisions 2/CP.18 
and  1/CP.19.  The  Co-Chairs  also  stressed  the  need  for  the  ADP  to  consider  how  to  take 
forward its work on the elements, and how to forward the results of this work to 2015.  

15. 
In  addition,  the  Co-Chairs  informed  the  ADP  of  the  calls  from  Parties  for  textual 
negotiations.  In  this  context,  the  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to  make  specific 
suggestions that seek to build bridges and clarify options so as to allow the contact group to 
collectively  advance  its  work  towards  a  draft  negotiating  text.  In  the  light  of  the  limited 
time  available  to  the  ADP  to  advance  this  work,  the  Co-Chairs  proposed  that  focused 
negotiations in the contact group on the elements for a draft negotiating text be undertaken 
in parallel and facilitated by either one of the Co-Chairs.  

16.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  recalled  the  work  undertaken  by  the  ADP  on 
draft decision texts on the identification of the information that Parties  will provide when 
putting forward their INDCs and on accelerating the implementation of enhanced pre-2020 
climate action. The Co-Chairs proposed that the contact group continue its work on these 
issues  through  textual  negotiations  with  a  view  to  agreeing  on  a  draft  decision  to  be 
recommended for consideration and adoption at COP 20.  

17. 
The Co-Chairs further drew the attention of delegates to the updated technical paper 
titled “Updated compilation of information on the mitigation benefits of actions, initiatives 
and options to enhance mitigation ambition”,10 prepared by the secretariat as requested by 
the  ADP  at  the  third  part  of  its  second  session.11  The  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to 
read  the  updated  technical  paper  and  to  bring  it  to  the  attention  of  the  relevant 
implementation officials in their respective governments.  

18. 
In  the  context  of  pre-2020  action,  the  Co-Chairs  also  informed  the  ADP  of  their 
request to the secretariat to cluster and enhance the visibility of side events and exhibits in 
Lima  that  were  directly  relevant  to  the  thematic  areas  explored  by  the  technical  expert 
meetings in 2014, and that further information on these events and exhibits was available 
on the UNFCCC website.12 

19.  At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the attention of delegates to the high-level 
ministerial  dialogue  on  climate  finance  and  the  high-level  ministerial  dialogue  on  the 
Durban  Platform  for  Enhanced  Action,  which  were  to  be  held  on  9  and  10  December, 
respectively.  They  expressed  their  appreciation  to  Mr.  Manuel  Pulgar-Vidal,  President  of 
COP 20 and the tenth session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the 
Parties to the Kyoto  Protocol (CMP), and his team  for the great efforts  made to facilitate 
the ADP process.

20. 
The  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to  attend  the  numerous  briefings,  forums  and 
events  on  areas  of  relevance  to  the  work  of  the  ADP  being  held  in  Lima  and  informed 
delegates that a list of these events was available on the UNFCCC website.13 

21.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  ADP  agreed  to  the  proposals  by  the  Co-Chairs  on  the 
organization of work by the ADP on item 3.  

22. 
The  ADP  met  on  6  December  to  take  stock  of  progress  made  and  to  consider  the 
possible way forward. Further to this informal meeting and in response to an invitation by 
the President of COP 20/CMP 10, on 8 December the Co-Chairs issued a revised version of 
the draft decision text referred to in paragraph 16 above and of the draft text containing the 
elements  for  a  draft  negotiating  text.  At  the  request  of  Parties,  a  compilation  of  textual 
inputs received from Parties14 was made available on the UNFCCC website.15 

23. 
Following the stocktaking meeting and the issuance of the draft texts referred to in 
paragraph  22  above,  the  ADP  further  focused  its  work,  including  through  line-by-line 
negotiations  on  the  draft  decision  text  on  agenda  item  3.  The  progress  of  this  work  was 
captured in: 

(a) 

A  revised  version  of  the  draft  text  containing  the  elements  for  a  draft 

negotiating text, issued on 10 December;  

(b) 

Revised  versions  of  the  draft  decision  text  on  agenda  item  3  reflecting  the 
status  of  the  negotiations,  made  available  on  the  UNFCCC  website  on  9,  10  and  11 
December.16 

24. 
Progress was also reflected in the oral reports by the ADP Co-Chairs to the informal 
stocktaking  plenaries  convened  by  the  President  of  COP 20/CMP 10  on  10,  11  and  12 
December. 

25. 
In  addition  to  the  consultations  with  Parties  undertaken  by  the  President  of 
COP 20/CMP  10  and  the  ongoing  ADP  negotiations,  on  12  December  the  President 
launched  ministerial  consultations  on  ADP  issues  facilitated  on  his  behalf  by  ministers 
Vivian Balakrishnan (Singapore) and Tine Sundtoft (Norway) with a view to facilitating a 
successful outcome of the ADP process. 

26.  On 13 December, the Co-Chairs convened an informal ADP meeting to introduce a 
further revised draft decision on agenda item 3 with an annex containing the elements for a 
draft negotiating text referred to in paragraph 23(a) above.17 

27.  On  the  same  day,  the  Co-Chairs  opened  the  14th  plenary  meeting  and  invited  the 
ADP to consider the draft decision referred to in paragraph 26 above.  

28.  At  the  beginning  of  the  meeting,  the  President  of  COP 20/CMP 10  recalled  the 
expectations for a successful outcome of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in 
Lima,  which  would  provide  a  solid  foundation  for  reaching  an  agreement  in  Paris.  The 
President  called  for  flexibility  and  encouraged  Parties  to  work  together  to  achieve  the 
successful outcome needed.  

29. 
Statements  were  made  by  representatives  of  41  Parties,  including  on  behalf  of  the 
Environmental Integrity Group, the African Group, the European Union and its 28 member 
States,  the  LDCs,  AILAC,  the  Like-minded  Developing  Countries,  the  League  of  Arab 
States and the BASIC countries.

(Agenda item 1) 

1. 
The seventh part of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban

Parties (COP) a clear and solid foundation for the new global climate change agreement to 
be  adopted  at  COP  21,  which  would  signal  to  the  world  the  determination  of  Parties  to 
deliver  a  successful  outcome  at  that  session  of  the  COP,  to  be  held  in  Paris,  France. The 
Co-Chairs reminded delegates of the need to identify the information that will be provided 
in relation to the intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) in accordance with

At  the  13th  meeting,  on  2  December,  the  Co-Chairs  drew  the  attention  of  the 
8. 
delegates to the scenario note prepared for the seventh part of the session,4 and outlined the 
arrangements made in the light of the organization of work previously agreed by the ADP, 
the  mandates  of  the  ADP,  including  those  given  at  COP  19,5  and  pre-sessional

established at the fourth part of the session.6  

9. 
At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs stressed the importance of optimizing the use of

(b)  A  draft  decision  text  on  advancing  the  Durban  Platform  for  Enhanced 

Action.9 

The  Co-Chairs  underlined  the  need  to  continue  the  consideration  and  further 
14. 
elaboration of the elements for a draft negotiating text with a view to making a negotiating 
text available before May 2015, in line with the  mandates contained in decisions 2/CP.18 
and  1/CP.19.  The  Co-Chairs  also  stressed  the  need  for  the  ADP  to  consider  how  to  take 
forward its work on the elements, and how to forward the results of this work to 2015.  

15. 
In  addition,  the  Co-Chairs  informed  the  ADP  of  the  calls  from  Parties  for  textual 
negotiations.  In  this  context,  the  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to  make  specific 
suggestions that seek to build bridges and clarify options so as to allow the contact group to 
collectively  advance  its  work  towards  a  draft  negotiating  text.  In  the  light  of  the  limited 
time  available  to  the  ADP  to  advance  this  work,  the  Co-Chairs  proposed  that  focused 
negotiations in the contact group on the elements for a draft negotiating text be undertaken 
in parallel and facilitated by either one of the Co-Chairs.  

16.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  recalled  the  work  undertaken  by  the  ADP  on 
draft decision texts on the identification of the information that Parties  will provide when 
putting forward their INDCs and on accelerating the implementation of enhanced pre-2020 
climate action. The Co-Chairs proposed that the contact group continue its work on these 
issues  through  textual  negotiations  with  a  view  to  agreeing  on  a  draft  decision  to  be 
recommended for consideration and adoption at COP 20.  

17. 
The Co-Chairs further drew the attention of delegates to the updated technical paper 
titled “Updated compilation of information on the mitigation benefits of actions, initiatives 
and options to enhance mitigation ambition”,10 prepared by the secretariat as requested by 
the  ADP  at  the  third  part  of  its  second  session.11  The  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to 
read  the  updated  technical  paper  and  to  bring  it  to  the  attention  of  the  relevant 
implementation officials in their respective governments.  

18. 
In  the  context  of  pre-2020  action,  the  Co-Chairs  also  informed  the  ADP  of  their 
request to the secretariat to cluster and enhance the visibility of side events and exhibits in 
Lima  that  were  directly  relevant  to  the  thematic  areas  explored  by  the  technical  expert 
meetings in 2014, and that further information on these events and exhibits was available 
on the UNFCCC website.12 

19.  At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the attention of delegates to the high-level 
ministerial  dialogue  on  climate  finance  and  the  high-level  ministerial  dialogue  on  the 
Durban  Platform  for  Enhanced  Action,  which  were  to  be  held  on  9  and  10  December, 
respectively.  They  expressed  their  appreciation  to  Mr.  Manuel  Pulgar-Vidal,  President  of 
COP 20 and the tenth session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the 
Parties to the Kyoto  Protocol (CMP), and his team  for the great efforts  made to facilitate 
the ADP process.

20. 
The  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to  attend  the  numerous  briefings,  forums  and 
events  on  areas  of  relevance  to  the  work  of  the  ADP  being  held  in  Lima  and  informed 
delegates that a list of these events was available on the UNFCCC website.13 

21.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  ADP  agreed  to  the  proposals  by  the  Co-Chairs  on  the 
organization of work by the ADP on item 3.  

22. 
The  ADP  met  on  6  December  to  take  stock  of  progress  made  and  to  consider  the 
possible way forward. Further to this informal meeting and in response to an invitation by 
the President of COP 20/CMP 10, on 8 December the Co-Chairs issued a revised version of 
the draft decision text referred to in paragraph 16 above and of the draft text containing the 
elements  for  a  draft  negotiating  text.  At  the  request  of  Parties,  a  compilation  of  textual 
inputs received from Parties14 was made available on the UNFCCC website.15 

23. 
Following the stocktaking meeting and the issuance of the draft texts referred to in 
paragraph  22  above,  the  ADP  further  focused  its  work,  including  through  line-by-line 
negotiations  on  the  draft  decision  text  on  agenda  item  3.  The  progress  of  this  work  was 
captured in: 

(a) 

A  revised  version  of  the  draft  text  containing  the  elements  for  a  draft 

negotiating text, issued on 10 December;  

(b) 

Revised  versions  of  the  draft  decision  text  on  agenda  item  3  reflecting  the 
status  of  the  negotiations,  made  available  on  the  UNFCCC  website  on  9,  10  and  11 
December.16 

24. 
Progress was also reflected in the oral reports by the ADP Co-Chairs to the informal 
stocktaking  plenaries  convened  by  the  President  of  COP 20/CMP 10  on  10,  11  and  12 
December. 

25. 
In  addition  to  the  consultations  with  Parties  undertaken  by  the  President  of 
COP 20/CMP  10  and  the  ongoing  ADP  negotiations,  on  12  December  the  President 
launched  ministerial  consultations  on  ADP  issues  facilitated  on  his  behalf  by  ministers 
Vivian Balakrishnan (Singapore) and Tine Sundtoft (Norway) with a view to facilitating a 
successful outcome of the ADP process. 

26.  On 13 December, the Co-Chairs convened an informal ADP meeting to introduce a 
further revised draft decision on agenda item 3 with an annex containing the elements for a 
draft negotiating text referred to in paragraph 23(a) above.17 

27.  On  the  same  day,  the  Co-Chairs  opened  the  14th  plenary  meeting  and  invited  the 
ADP to consider the draft decision referred to in paragraph 26 above.  

28.  At  the  beginning  of  the  meeting,  the  President  of  COP 20/CMP 10  recalled  the 
expectations for a successful outcome of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in 
Lima,  which  would  provide  a  solid  foundation  for  reaching  an  agreement  in  Paris.  The 
President  called  for  flexibility  and  encouraged  Parties  to  work  together  to  achieve  the 
successful outcome needed.  

29. 
Statements  were  made  by  representatives  of  41  Parties,  including  on  behalf  of  the 
Environmental Integrity Group, the African Group, the European Union and its 28 member 
States,  the  LDCs,  AILAC,  the  Like-minded  Developing  Countries,  the  League  of  Arab 
States and the BASIC countries.

I.  Opening of the session 

(Agenda item 1) 

1. 
The seventh part of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban 
Platform  for  Enhanced  Action  (ADP)  was  held  at  the  United  Nations  Climate  Change 
Conference, Lima, Peru, from 2 to 13 December 2014.1 

2. 
The  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP,  Mr.  Kishan  Kumarsingh  (non-Annex  I)  and  Mr. Artur 
Runge-Metzger (Annex I), resumed the second session and opened the 13th plenary meeting 
on 2 December. They welcomed all Parties and observers. They also welcomed Ms. Anna 
Serzysko (Annex I) as Rapporteur of the ADP.2 

3. 
The  Co-Chairs  stressed  the  need  for  the  ADP  to  provide  to  the  Conference  of  the 
Parties (COP) a clear and solid foundation for the new global climate change agreement to 
be  adopted  at  COP  21,  which  would  signal  to  the  world  the  determination  of  Parties  to 
deliver  a  successful  outcome  at  that  session  of  the  COP,  to  be  held  in  Paris,  France. The 
Co-Chairs reminded delegates of the need to identify the information that will be provided 
in relation to the intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) in accordance with 
decision 1/CP.19 and called for the strengthening and acceleration of climate action prior to 
2020 through a decision that was to be considered and adopted at COP 20.

States,  the  least  developed  countries  (LDCs),  the  Independent  Association  for  Latin 
America and the Caribbean (AILAC), the Central American Integration System, the League 
of  Arab  States,  the  BASIC  countries  (Brazil,  China,  India  and  South  Africa),  the  Like-
minded  Developing  Countries  and  the  Coalition  for  Rainforest  Nations.  In  addition,

(NGOs), farmers NGOs, indigenous peoples organizations, local government and municipal 
authorities,  trade  union  NGOs,  women  and  gender  NGOs,  youth  NGOs  and  business  and 
industry NGOs.  

II.  Organizational matters

B.  Adoption of the agenda 

(Agenda item 2(b)) 

The  agenda  for  the  second  session  of  the  ADP  was  adopted  by  the  ADP  at  the  1st 

7. 
meeting of the session, on 29 April 2013.3  

C.  Organization of the work of the session 

(Agenda item 2(c)) 

At  the  13th  meeting,  on  2  December,  the  Co-Chairs  drew  the  attention  of  the 
8. 
delegates to the scenario note prepared for the seventh part of the session,4 and outlined the 
arrangements made in the light of the organization of work previously agreed by the ADP, 
the  mandates  of  the  ADP,  including  those  given  at  COP  19,5  and  pre-sessional 
consultations.  The  organization  of  the  work  on  agenda  item  3  included  a  contact  group 
established at the fourth part of the session.6  

9. 
At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs stressed the importance of optimizing the use of 
the limited time available and informed the ADP of the greater efforts on time management 
undertaken  by  the  Chairs  of  the  subsidiary  bodies  in  consultation  with  the  Bureau  of  the 
COP and the negotiating groups to strengthen inclusivity, discipline, respect and fairness. 

In addition, the Co-Chairs informed Parties of their intention to hold a special event 

10. 
with observers during the session. This event took place on 5 December. 

III.  Implementation of all the elements of decision 1/CP.17 

(Agenda item 3) 

1.  Proceedings 

The ADP considered this item at its 13th meeting, as well as at its 14th meeting, on 
11. 
13  December.  It  had  before  it  documents  FCCC/ADP/2014/3,  FCCC/ADP/2014/L.4, 
FCCC/ADP/2014/L.5,  FCCC/ADP/2014/CRP.4  and  FCCC/2014/TP/13  and  Add.1–4,  as 
well as the informal notes prepared for the seventh part of the session.7 

12.  At the 13th meeting, the Co-Chairs recalled the establishment of the contact group on 
item 3, referred to in paragraph  8 above, and its  mandate  to  work in accordance  with the 
agreed  agenda  and  established  UNFCCC  practice.  They  also  recalled  the  core  principles 
guiding the work of the ADP, namely that the process will continue to be Party-driven and 
build  on  inputs  from  Parties,  and  that  any  outputs  of  the  process  will  reflect  inputs  from 
Parties.  

13.  At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the attention of delegates to the informal 
documents prepared by the Co-Chairs and aimed at supporting delegates by providing focus

to the negotiations and capturing the progress made by the ADP as well as the submissions 
received, namely: 

(a) 

A non-paper on elements for a draft negotiating text updating the earlier non-

paper;8 

(b)  A  draft  decision  text  on  advancing  the  Durban  Platform  for  Enhanced 

Action.9 

The  Co-Chairs  underlined  the  need  to  continue  the  consideration  and  further 
14. 
elaboration of the elements for a draft negotiating text with a view to making a negotiating 
text available before May 2015, in line with the  mandates contained in decisions 2/CP.18 
and  1/CP.19.  The  Co-Chairs  also  stressed  the  need  for  the  ADP  to  consider  how  to  take 
forward its work on the elements, and how to forward the results of this work to 2015.  

15. 
In  addition,  the  Co-Chairs  informed  the  ADP  of  the  calls  from  Parties  for  textual 
negotiations.  In  this  context,  the  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to  make  specific 
suggestions that seek to build bridges and clarify options so as to allow the contact group to 
collectively  advance  its  work  towards  a  draft  negotiating  text.  In  the  light  of  the  limited 
time  available  to  the  ADP  to  advance  this  work,  the  Co-Chairs  proposed  that  focused 
negotiations in the contact group on the elements for a draft negotiating text be undertaken 
in parallel and facilitated by either one of the Co-Chairs.  

16.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  recalled  the  work  undertaken  by  the  ADP  on 
draft decision texts on the identification of the information that Parties  will provide when 
putting forward their INDCs and on accelerating the implementation of enhanced pre-2020 
climate action. The Co-Chairs proposed that the contact group continue its work on these 
issues  through  textual  negotiations  with  a  view  to  agreeing  on  a  draft  decision  to  be 
recommended for consideration and adoption at COP 20.  

17. 
The Co-Chairs further drew the attention of delegates to the updated technical paper 
titled “Updated compilation of information on the mitigation benefits of actions, initiatives 
and options to enhance mitigation ambition”,10 prepared by the secretariat as requested by 
the  ADP  at  the  third  part  of  its  second  session.11  The  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to 
read  the  updated  technical  paper  and  to  bring  it  to  the  attention  of  the  relevant 
implementation officials in their respective governments.  

18. 
In  the  context  of  pre-2020  action,  the  Co-Chairs  also  informed  the  ADP  of  their 
request to the secretariat to cluster and enhance the visibility of side events and exhibits in 
Lima  that  were  directly  relevant  to  the  thematic  areas  explored  by  the  technical  expert 
meetings in 2014, and that further information on these events and exhibits was available 
on the UNFCCC website.12 

19.  At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the attention of delegates to the high-level 
ministerial  dialogue  on  climate  finance  and  the  high-level  ministerial  dialogue  on  the 
Durban  Platform  for  Enhanced  Action,  which  were  to  be  held  on  9  and  10  December, 
respectively.  They  expressed  their  appreciation  to  Mr.  Manuel  Pulgar-Vidal,  President  of 
COP 20 and the tenth session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the 
Parties to the Kyoto  Protocol (CMP), and his team  for the great efforts  made to facilitate 
the ADP process.

20. 
The  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to  attend  the  numerous  briefings,  forums  and 
events  on  areas  of  relevance  to  the  work  of  the  ADP  being  held  in  Lima  and  informed 
delegates that a list of these events was available on the UNFCCC website.13 

21.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  ADP  agreed  to  the  proposals  by  the  Co-Chairs  on  the 
organization of work by the ADP on item 3.  

22. 
The  ADP  met  on  6  December  to  take  stock  of  progress  made  and  to  consider  the 
possible way forward. Further to this informal meeting and in response to an invitation by 
the President of COP 20/CMP 10, on 8 December the Co-Chairs issued a revised version of 
the draft decision text referred to in paragraph 16 above and of the draft text containing the 
elements  for  a  draft  negotiating  text.  At  the  request  of  Parties,  a  compilation  of  textual 
inputs received from Parties14 was made available on the UNFCCC website.15 

23. 
Following the stocktaking meeting and the issuance of the draft texts referred to in 
paragraph  22  above,  the  ADP  further  focused  its  work,  including  through  line-by-line 
negotiations  on  the  draft  decision  text  on  agenda  item  3.  The  progress  of  this  work  was 
captured in: 

(a) 

A  revised  version  of  the  draft  text  containing  the  elements  for  a  draft 

negotiating text, issued on 10 December;  

(b) 

Revised  versions  of  the  draft  decision  text  on  agenda  item  3  reflecting  the 
status  of  the  negotiations,  made  available  on  the  UNFCCC  website  on  9,  10  and  11 
December.16 

24. 
Progress was also reflected in the oral reports by the ADP Co-Chairs to the informal 
stocktaking  plenaries  convened  by  the  President  of  COP 20/CMP 10  on  10,  11  and  12 
December. 

25. 
In  addition  to  the  consultations  with  Parties  undertaken  by  the  President  of 
COP 20/CMP  10  and  the  ongoing  ADP  negotiations,  on  12  December  the  President 
launched  ministerial  consultations  on  ADP  issues  facilitated  on  his  behalf  by  ministers 
Vivian Balakrishnan (Singapore) and Tine Sundtoft (Norway) with a view to facilitating a 
successful outcome of the ADP process. 

26.  On 13 December, the Co-Chairs convened an informal ADP meeting to introduce a 
further revised draft decision on agenda item 3 with an annex containing the elements for a 
draft negotiating text referred to in paragraph 23(a) above.17 

27.  On  the  same  day,  the  Co-Chairs  opened  the  14th  plenary  meeting  and  invited  the 
ADP to consider the draft decision referred to in paragraph 26 above.  

28.  At  the  beginning  of  the  meeting,  the  President  of  COP 20/CMP 10  recalled  the 
expectations for a successful outcome of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in 
Lima,  which  would  provide  a  solid  foundation  for  reaching  an  agreement  in  Paris.  The 
President  called  for  flexibility  and  encouraged  Parties  to  work  together  to  achieve  the 
successful outcome needed.  

29. 
Statements  were  made  by  representatives  of  41  Parties,  including  on  behalf  of  the 
Environmental Integrity Group, the African Group, the European Union and its 28 member 
States,  the  LDCs,  AILAC,  the  Like-minded  Developing  Countries,  the  League  of  Arab 
States and the BASIC countries.

I.  Opening of the session 

(Agenda item 1) 

1. 
The seventh part of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban 
Platform  for  Enhanced  Action  (ADP)  was  held  at  the  United  Nations  Climate  Change 
Conference, Lima, Peru, from 2 to 13 December 2014.1 

2. 
The  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP,  Mr.  Kishan  Kumarsingh  (non-Annex  I)  and  Mr. Artur 
Runge-Metzger (Annex I), resumed the second session and opened the 13th plenary meeting 
on 2 December. They welcomed all Parties and observers. They also welcomed Ms. Anna 
Serzysko (Annex I) as Rapporteur of the ADP.2 

3. 
The  Co-Chairs  stressed  the  need  for  the  ADP  to  provide  to  the  Conference  of  the 
Parties (COP) a clear and solid foundation for the new global climate change agreement to 
be  adopted  at  COP  21,  which  would  signal  to  the  world  the  determination  of  Parties  to 
deliver  a  successful  outcome  at  that  session  of  the  COP,  to  be  held  in  Paris,  France. The 
Co-Chairs reminded delegates of the need to identify the information that will be provided 
in relation to the intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) in accordance with 
decision 1/CP.19 and called for the strengthening and acceleration of climate action prior to 
2020 through a decision that was to be considered and adopted at COP 20. 

4.

Group  of  77  and  China,  the  European  Union  and  its  28  member  States,  the  Umbrella 
Group, the Environmental Integrity Group, the African Group, the Alliance of Small Island 
States,  the  least  developed  countries  (LDCs),  the  Independent  Association  for  Latin 
America and the Caribbean (AILAC), the Central American Integration System, the League 
of  Arab  States,  the  BASIC  countries  (Brazil,  China,  India  and  South  Africa),  the  Like-
minded  Developing  Countries  and  the  Coalition  for  Rainforest  Nations.  In  addition, 
statements  were  made  on  behalf  of  environmental  non-governmental  organizations 
(NGOs), farmers NGOs, indigenous peoples organizations, local government and municipal 
authorities,  trade  union  NGOs,  women  and  gender  NGOs,  youth  NGOs  and  business  and 
industry NGOs.  

II.  Organizational matters

B.  Adoption of the agenda 

(Agenda item 2(b)) 

The  agenda  for  the  second  session  of  the  ADP  was  adopted  by  the  ADP  at  the  1st 

7. 
meeting of the session, on 29 April 2013.3  

C.  Organization of the work of the session 

(Agenda item 2(c)) 

At  the  13th  meeting,  on  2  December,  the  Co-Chairs  drew  the  attention  of  the 
8. 
delegates to the scenario note prepared for the seventh part of the session,4 and outlined the 
arrangements made in the light of the organization of work previously agreed by the ADP, 
the  mandates  of  the  ADP,  including  those  given  at  COP  19,5  and  pre-sessional 
consultations.  The  organization  of  the  work  on  agenda  item  3  included  a  contact  group 
established at the fourth part of the session.6  

9. 
At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs stressed the importance of optimizing the use of 
the limited time available and informed the ADP of the greater efforts on time management 
undertaken  by  the  Chairs  of  the  subsidiary  bodies  in  consultation  with  the  Bureau  of  the 
COP and the negotiating groups to strengthen inclusivity, discipline, respect and fairness. 

In addition, the Co-Chairs informed Parties of their intention to hold a special event 

10. 
with observers during the session. This event took place on 5 December. 

III.  Implementation of all the elements of decision 1/CP.17 

(Agenda item 3) 

1.  Proceedings 

The ADP considered this item at its 13th meeting, as well as at its 14th meeting, on 
11. 
13  December.  It  had  before  it  documents  FCCC/ADP/2014/3,  FCCC/ADP/2014/L.4, 
FCCC/ADP/2014/L.5,  FCCC/ADP/2014/CRP.4  and  FCCC/2014/TP/13  and  Add.1–4,  as 
well as the informal notes prepared for the seventh part of the session.7 

12.  At the 13th meeting, the Co-Chairs recalled the establishment of the contact group on 
item 3, referred to in paragraph  8 above, and its  mandate  to  work in accordance  with the 
agreed  agenda  and  established  UNFCCC  practice.  They  also  recalled  the  core  principles 
guiding the work of the ADP, namely that the process will continue to be Party-driven and 
build  on  inputs  from  Parties,  and  that  any  outputs  of  the  process  will  reflect  inputs  from 
Parties.  

13.  At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the attention of delegates to the informal 
documents prepared by the Co-Chairs and aimed at supporting delegates by providing focus

to the negotiations and capturing the progress made by the ADP as well as the submissions 
received, namely: 

(a) 

A non-paper on elements for a draft negotiating text updating the earlier non-

paper;8 

(b)  A  draft  decision  text  on  advancing  the  Durban  Platform  for  Enhanced 

Action.9 

The  Co-Chairs  underlined  the  need  to  continue  the  consideration  and  further 
14. 
elaboration of the elements for a draft negotiating text with a view to making a negotiating 
text available before May 2015, in line with the  mandates contained in decisions 2/CP.18 
and  1/CP.19.  The  Co-Chairs  also  stressed  the  need  for  the  ADP  to  consider  how  to  take 
forward its work on the elements, and how to forward the results of this work to 2015.  

15. 
In  addition,  the  Co-Chairs  informed  the  ADP  of  the  calls  from  Parties  for  textual 
negotiations.  In  this  context,  the  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to  make  specific 
suggestions that seek to build bridges and clarify options so as to allow the contact group to 
collectively  advance  its  work  towards  a  draft  negotiating  text.  In  the  light  of  the  limited 
time  available  to  the  ADP  to  advance  this  work,  the  Co-Chairs  proposed  that  focused 
negotiations in the contact group on the elements for a draft negotiating text be undertaken 
in parallel and facilitated by either one of the Co-Chairs.  

16.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  recalled  the  work  undertaken  by  the  ADP  on 
draft decision texts on the identification of the information that Parties  will provide when 
putting forward their INDCs and on accelerating the implementation of enhanced pre-2020 
climate action. The Co-Chairs proposed that the contact group continue its work on these 
issues  through  textual  negotiations  with  a  view  to  agreeing  on  a  draft  decision  to  be 
recommended for consideration and adoption at COP 20.  

17. 
The Co-Chairs further drew the attention of delegates to the updated technical paper 
titled “Updated compilation of information on the mitigation benefits of actions, initiatives 
and options to enhance mitigation ambition”,10 prepared by the secretariat as requested by 
the  ADP  at  the  third  part  of  its  second  session.11  The  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to 
read  the  updated  technical  paper  and  to  bring  it  to  the  attention  of  the  relevant 
implementation officials in their respective governments.  

18. 
In  the  context  of  pre-2020  action,  the  Co-Chairs  also  informed  the  ADP  of  their 
request to the secretariat to cluster and enhance the visibility of side events and exhibits in 
Lima  that  were  directly  relevant  to  the  thematic  areas  explored  by  the  technical  expert 
meetings in 2014, and that further information on these events and exhibits was available 
on the UNFCCC website.12 

19.  At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the attention of delegates to the high-level 
ministerial  dialogue  on  climate  finance  and  the  high-level  ministerial  dialogue  on  the 
Durban  Platform  for  Enhanced  Action,  which  were  to  be  held  on  9  and  10  December, 
respectively.  They  expressed  their  appreciation  to  Mr.  Manuel  Pulgar-Vidal,  President  of 
COP 20 and the tenth session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the 
Parties to the Kyoto  Protocol (CMP), and his team  for the great efforts  made to facilitate 
the ADP process.

20. 
The  Co-Chairs  encouraged  delegates  to  attend  the  numerous  briefings,  forums  and 
events  on  areas  of  relevance  to  the  work  of  the  ADP  being  held  in  Lima  and  informed 
delegates that a list of these events was available on the UNFCCC website.13 

21.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  ADP  agreed  to  the  proposals  by  the  Co-Chairs  on  the 
organization of work by the ADP on item 3.  

22. 
The  ADP  met  on  6  December  to  take  stock  of  progress  made  and  to  consider  the 
possible way forward. Further to this informal meeting and in response to an invitation by 
the President of COP 20/CMP 10, on 8 December the Co-Chairs issued a revised version of 
the draft decision text referred to in paragraph 16 above and of the draft text containing the 
elements  for  a  draft  negotiating  text.  At  the  request  of  Parties,  a  compilation  of  textual 
inputs received from Parties14 was made available on the UNFCCC website.15 

23. 
Following the stocktaking meeting and the issuance of the draft texts referred to in 
paragraph  22  above,  the  ADP  further  focused  its  work,  including  through  line-by-line 
negotiations  on  the  draft  decision  text  on  agenda  item  3.  The  progress  of  this  work  was 
captured in: 

(a) 

A  revised  version  of  the  draft  text  containing  the  elements  for  a  draft 

negotiating text, issued on 10 December;  

(b) 

Revised  versions  of  the  draft  decision  text  on  agenda  item  3  reflecting  the 
status  of  the  negotiations,  made  available  on  the  UNFCCC  website  on  9,  10  and  11 
December.16 

24. 
Progress was also reflected in the oral reports by the ADP Co-Chairs to the informal 
stocktaking  plenaries  convened  by  the  President  of  COP 20/CMP 10  on  10,  11  and  12 
December. 

25. 
In  addition  to  the  consultations  with  Parties  undertaken  by  the  President  of 
COP 20/CMP  10  and  the  ongoing  ADP  negotiations,  on  12  December  the  President 
launched  ministerial  consultations  on  ADP  issues  facilitated  on  his  behalf  by  ministers 
Vivian Balakrishnan (Singapore) and Tine Sundtoft (Norway) with a view to facilitating a 
successful outcome of the ADP process. 

26.  On 13 December, the Co-Chairs convened an informal ADP meeting to introduce a 
further revised draft decision on agenda item 3 with an annex containing the elements for a
