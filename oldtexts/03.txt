I.  Opening of the session 

(Agenda item 1) 

The ninth part of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the  Durban 
1. 
Platform  for  Enhanced  Action  (ADP)  was  held  at  the  World  Conference  Center  Bonn  in 
Bonn, Germany, from 1 to 11 June 2015.1 

The  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP,  Mr.  Ahmed  Djoghlaf  (non-Annex  I)  and  Mr.  Daniel 
2. 
Reifsnyder (Annex I), resumed the second session  of the ADP by opening its 17th plenary 
meeting on 1 June 2015. They welcomed all Parties and observers as well as Ms. Yang Liu 
(non-Annex I), Rapporteur of the ADP.2 

In order to advance the mandates and timelines agreed on at the seventeenth session 
3. 
of the Conference of the Parties (COP),3 as well as at COP 18,4 195 and 20,6 the Co-Chairs 
identified the objectives of the ninth part of the second session, namely to help to prepare a 
concise,  coherent  and  streamlined  negotiating  text  so  as  to  facilitate  negotiations  of 
substantive issues among Parties, and to provide the ADP with an opportunity to continue 
its efforts to facilitate pre-2020 climate action. 

4. 
Statements  were  made  by  representatives  of  14  Parties,  including  on  behalf  of  the 
Group  of  77  and  China,  the  Umbrella  Group,  the  European  Union  and  its  28  member 
States,  the  Environmental  Integrity  Group,  the  least  developed  countries,  the  African 
Group,  the  Alliance  of  Small  Island  States,  the  League  of  Arab  States,  the  Bolivarian 
Alliance  for  the  Peoples  of  Our  America  –  Peoples’  Trade  Treaty,  the  Independent 
Association for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Coalition for Rainforest Nations, the 
Like-minded  Developing  Countries,  the  BASIC  countries  (Brazil,  China,  India  and  South 
Africa),  and  the  Caribbean  Community.  Many  Parties  refrained  from  making  their 
statement in the room, choosing instead to make these available on the UNFCCC website, 
and thereby allowed the substantive negotiations to start without delay.7 

Also  at  the  17th  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  invited  the  Presidency  of  COP  20  and  the 
5. 
tenth session of the Conference of the  Parties serving as the  meeting of the Parties to the 
Kyoto Protocol (CMP), the incoming Presidency of COP 21/CMP 11 and other Parties to 
inform  delegates  of  initiatives  already  undertaken  to  help  to  ensure  the  success  of 
COP 21/CMP 11. Peru reported on the informal dialogue organized by the Government of 
Peru  in  Lima,  Peru,  from  20  to  22  March  2015,  while  France  reported  on  the  informal 
consultations on the preparation of COP 21 held in Paris, France, from 6 to 8 May 2015.8 In 

1  The report on the first and second parts of the second session of the ADP is contained in document

II.  Organizational matters 

(Agenda item 2) 

A.  Adoption of the agenda

The  agenda  for  the  second  session  of  the  ADP  was  adopted  by  the  ADP  at  the 

6. 
1st meeting of the session, on 29 April 2013.10 

B.  Organization of the work of the session 

(Agenda item 2(c)) 

At the 17th meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the delegates’ attention to the scenario note 
7. 
prepared for the ninth part of the session,11 and to their further clarification on the method 
of work for the session.12 The proposed organization of the work on agenda item 3 included 
a contact group established at the fourth part of the session,13 as well as facilitated meetings 
on  specific  issues  in  the  sections  of  the  negotiating  text  and  workstream  2.  The  ADP 
proceeded on the basis of the proposed organization of work. 

In addition, the Co-Chairs informed Parties of their intention to hold a special event 

8. 
with observers during the session. This event took place on 10 June.14 

III.  Implementation of all the elements of decision 1/CP.17 

(Agenda item 3) 

The  ADP  considered  this  agenda  item  at  its  17th  meeting,  as  well  as  at  its  18th 
9. 
meeting,  held  on  11  June.  It  had  before  it  the  negotiating  text,15  the  informal  note16  on 
overlaps  and  duplication  in  that  negotiating  text,  the  scenario  note  prepared  for  the  ninth

10. 
Throughout the session, Party inputs to the negotiations as well as the outputs of the 
facilitated meetings were captured and made publicly available on the UNFCCC website.19 
This  resulted  in  multiple  iterations  of  both  a  working  document  and  a  streamlined  and 
consolidated text. These were also made available on the UNFCCC website.20 

11. 
In  the  context  of  work  on  pre-2020  climate  action,  including  on  how  to  further 
advance  workstream  2,  Parties  exchanged  views  in  the  contact  group  and  in  facilitated 
meetings. The output of these meetings has been posted on the UNFCCC website.21 

12. 
Such  work  was  accompanied  by  discussions  in  the  technical  expert  meetings  on 
renewable  energy  supply  convened  on  3  June22  and  on  energy  efficiency  in  urban 
environments  convened  on  5  and  6  June,23  facilitated  by  Mr.  Amit  Kumar  (India)  and 
Ms. Sylvie Lemmet (France), respectively.  

13.  On 4 June, the ADP contact group took stock of the progress of work. The Chair of 
the  Subsidiary  Body  for  Implementation,  Mr,  Amena  Yauvoli,  represented  by  the 
Rapporteur,  Mr.  Sidat  Yaffa,24  and  the  Chair  of  the  Subsidiary  Body  for  Scientific  and 
Technological Advice, Ms. Lidia Wojtal,25 were invited to update the ADP on agenda items 
of their subsidiary bodies related to the work of the ADP.  

14. 
The ADP contact group held an additional stocktaking meeting on 8 June to further 
assess the progress made during the session. At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs provided 
Parties with guidance for work at the remainder of the session. 

15.  At its 18th meeting, the ADP had before it the revised streamlined and consolidated 
text dated 11 June 2015, the working document of the same date, as well as the Co-Chairs’ 
suggestions on the way forward for the preparation of the tenth part of the session.26  

16.  At  the  same  meeting,  Parties  agreed  that  an  additional  tool  was  needed  for  the 
preparations  for  the  tenth  part  of  the  session.  They  requested  the  Co-Chairs,  with  the 
support  of  the  secretariat  and  the  co-facilitators,  to  make  available  to  Parties  “a  single 
document based on the structure of annex II to the scenario note of 5 May 2015, guided by 
the  views  expressed  by  Parties  during  the  8  June  stocktaking  meeting,  taking  fully  into 
account  the  discussions  in  the  75  meetings  of  the  ADP  negotiating  groups  as  well  as  the 
facilitation  groups.  It  will  include  a  fully  streamlined,  consolidated,  clear  and  concise 
version of the Geneva negotiating text27 that will present clear options and will not omit or 
delete  any  option  or  position  of  Parties.  It  will  separate  paragraphs  of  the  Geneva 
negotiating text that are, by their nature, obviously appropriate for inclusion in a draft COP 
decision from paragraphs that are, by their nature, obviously appropriate for inclusion in the 
Paris  agreement.  Issues  clearly  requiring  further  substantive  negotiation  among  Parties  to 
determine  their  placement  will  remain  in  the  streamlined,  consolidated,  clear  and  concise 
Geneva negotiating text without inclusion in either category and will be clearly identified.” 
In  order  to  further  advance  the  negotiations  on  workstream  2,  the  Co-Chairs  will  also

prepare a document with elements for a draft decision on workstream 2 of the ADP as a key 
piece of the package to be considered at the Paris Conference.  

17. 
The  Co-Chairs  invited  the  secretariat  to  provide  delegates  with  information  on  the 
administrative  and  budgetary  implications  of,  and  on  the  status  of  funding  for,  holding 
additional sessions of the ADP in 2015. The Deputy Executive Secretary informed Parties 
that  there  is  an  outstanding  requirement  of  EUR  3.1  million  that  need  to  be  secured  in  a 
timely  manner  in  order  to  enable  the  participation  of  representatives  of  eligible  Parties  at 
the remaining sessions of the ADP and the COP in 2015. The Parties were further informed 
that EUR 100,000 is still required to complete the financing of the logistical arrangements 
for the October session of the ADP. 

18. 
Closing statements were made on behalf of the Presidency of COP 20/CMP 10 and 
the  incoming  Presidency  of  COP  21/CMP  11.  In  addition,  three  Parties  made  statements 
available on the UNFCCC website, including on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, the 
European Union and its 28 member States and the African Group.28 

IV.  Report on the ninth part of the second session 

(Agenda item 5) 

19.  At  its  18th  meeting,  the  ADP  considered  and  adopted  the  draft  report  on  the  ninth 
part of its second session.29 At the same meeting, on a proposal of the Co-Chairs, the ADP 
authorized the Rapporteur to complete the report on the  ninth part of the session, with the 
assistance of the secretariat and under the guidance of the Co-Chairs. 

V.  Suspension of the session 

20.  At its 18th meeting, the ADP agreed on a proposal of the Co-Chairs to suspend the 
second session and resume it in August 2015 in Bonn at its tenth part. 

21.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP  expressed  their  appreciation  to 
Parties for their work and support, and declared the second session of the ADP suspended.

10. 
Throughout the session, Party inputs to the negotiations as well as the outputs of the 
facilitated meetings were captured and made publicly available on the UNFCCC website.19 
This  resulted  in  multiple  iterations  of  both  a  working  document  and  a  streamlined  and 
consolidated text. These were also made available on the UNFCCC website.20 

11. 
In  the  context  of  work  on  pre-2020  climate  action,  including  on  how  to  further 
advance  workstream  2,  Parties  exchanged  views  in  the  contact  group  and  in  facilitated 
meetings. The output of these meetings has been posted on the UNFCCC website.21 

12. 
Such  work  was  accompanied  by  discussions  in  the  technical  expert  meetings  on 
renewable  energy  supply  convened  on  3  June22  and  on  energy  efficiency  in  urban 
environments  convened  on  5  and  6  June,23  facilitated  by  Mr.  Amit  Kumar  (India)  and 
Ms. Sylvie Lemmet (France), respectively.  

13.  On 4 June, the ADP contact group took stock of the progress of work. The Chair of 
the  Subsidiary  Body  for  Implementation,  Mr,  Amena  Yauvoli,  represented  by  the 
Rapporteur,  Mr.  Sidat  Yaffa,24  and  the  Chair  of  the  Subsidiary  Body  for  Scientific  and 
Technological Advice, Ms. Lidia Wojtal,25 were invited to update the ADP on agenda items 
of their subsidiary bodies related to the work of the ADP.  

14. 
The ADP contact group held an additional stocktaking meeting on 8 June to further 
assess the progress made during the session. At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs provided 
Parties with guidance for work at the remainder of the session. 

15.  At its 18th meeting, the ADP had before it the revised streamlined and consolidated 
text dated 11 June 2015, the working document of the same date, as well as the Co-Chairs’ 
suggestions on the way forward for the preparation of the tenth part of the session.26  

16.  At  the  same  meeting,  Parties  agreed  that  an  additional  tool  was  needed  for  the 
preparations  for  the  tenth  part  of  the  session.  They  requested  the  Co-Chairs,  with  the 
support  of  the  secretariat  and  the  co-facilitators,  to  make  available  to  Parties  “a  single 
document based on the structure of annex II to the scenario note of 5 May 2015, guided by 
the  views  expressed  by  Parties  during  the  8  June  stocktaking  meeting,  taking  fully  into 
account  the  discussions  in  the  75  meetings  of  the  ADP  negotiating  groups  as  well  as  the 
facilitation  groups.  It  will  include  a  fully  streamlined,  consolidated,  clear  and  concise 
version of the Geneva negotiating text27 that will present clear options and will not omit or 
delete  any  option  or  position  of  Parties.  It  will  separate  paragraphs  of  the  Geneva 
negotiating text that are, by their nature, obviously appropriate for inclusion in a draft COP 
decision from paragraphs that are, by their nature, obviously appropriate for inclusion in the 
Paris  agreement.  Issues  clearly  requiring  further  substantive  negotiation  among  Parties  to 
determine  their  placement  will  remain  in  the  streamlined,  consolidated,  clear  and  concise 
Geneva negotiating text without inclusion in either category and will be clearly identified.” 
In  order  to  further  advance  the  negotiations  on  workstream  2,  the  Co-Chairs  will  also

piece of the package to be considered at the Paris Conference.  

17. 
The  Co-Chairs  invited  the  secretariat  to  provide  delegates  with  information  on  the 
administrative  and  budgetary  implications  of,  and  on  the  status  of  funding  for,  holding 
additional sessions of the ADP in 2015. The Deputy Executive Secretary informed Parties 
that  there  is  an  outstanding  requirement  of  EUR  3.1  million  that  need  to  be  secured  in  a 
timely  manner  in  order  to  enable  the  participation  of  representatives  of  eligible  Parties  at 
the remaining sessions of the ADP and the COP in 2015. The Parties were further informed 
that EUR 100,000 is still required to complete the financing of the logistical arrangements 
for the October session of the ADP. 

18. 
Closing statements were made on behalf of the Presidency of COP 20/CMP 10 and 
the  incoming  Presidency  of  COP  21/CMP  11.  In  addition,  three  Parties  made  statements 
available on the UNFCCC website, including on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, the 
European Union and its 28 member States and the African Group.28 

IV.  Report on the ninth part of the second session 

(Agenda item 5) 

19.  At  its  18th  meeting,  the  ADP  considered  and  adopted  the  draft  report  on  the  ninth 
part of its second session.29 At the same meeting, on a proposal of the Co-Chairs, the ADP 
authorized the Rapporteur to complete the report on the  ninth part of the session, with the 
assistance of the secretariat and under the guidance of the Co-Chairs. 

V.  Suspension of the session 

20.  At its 18th meeting, the ADP agreed on a proposal of the Co-Chairs to suspend the 
second session and resume it in August 2015 in Bonn at its tenth part. 

21.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP  expressed  their  appreciation  to 
Parties for their work and support, and declared the second session of the ADP suspended.

I.  Opening of the session 

(Agenda item 1) 

The ninth part of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the  Durban 
1. 
Platform  for  Enhanced  Action  (ADP)  was  held  at  the  World  Conference  Center  Bonn  in 
Bonn, Germany, from 1 to 11 June 2015.1 

The  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP,  Mr.  Ahmed  Djoghlaf  (non-Annex  I)  and  Mr.  Daniel 
2. 
Reifsnyder (Annex I), resumed the second session  of the ADP by opening its 17th plenary 
meeting on 1 June 2015. They welcomed all Parties and observers as well as Ms. Yang Liu 
(non-Annex I), Rapporteur of the ADP.2 

In order to advance the mandates and timelines agreed on at the seventeenth session 
3. 
of the Conference of the Parties (COP),3 as well as at COP 18,4 195 and 20,6 the Co-Chairs 
identified the objectives of the ninth part of the second session, namely to help to prepare a 
concise,  coherent  and  streamlined  negotiating  text  so  as  to  facilitate  negotiations  of 
substantive issues among Parties, and to provide the ADP with an opportunity to continue 
its efforts to facilitate pre-2020 climate action. 

4. 
Statements  were  made  by  representatives  of  14  Parties,  including  on  behalf  of  the 
Group  of  77  and  China,  the  Umbrella  Group,  the  European  Union  and  its  28  member 
States,  the  Environmental  Integrity  Group,  the  least  developed  countries,  the  African 
Group,  the  Alliance  of  Small  Island  States,  the  League  of  Arab  States,  the  Bolivarian 
Alliance  for  the  Peoples  of  Our  America  –  Peoples’  Trade  Treaty,  the  Independent 
Association for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Coalition for Rainforest Nations, the 
Like-minded  Developing  Countries,  the  BASIC  countries  (Brazil,  China,  India  and  South 
Africa),  and  the  Caribbean  Community.  Many  Parties  refrained  from  making  their 
statement in the room, choosing instead to make these available on the UNFCCC website, 
and thereby allowed the substantive negotiations to start without delay.7 

Also  at  the  17th  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  invited  the  Presidency  of  COP  20  and  the 
5. 
tenth session of the Conference of the  Parties serving as the  meeting of the Parties to the 
Kyoto Protocol (CMP), the incoming Presidency of COP 21/CMP 11 and other Parties to 
inform  delegates  of  initiatives  already  undertaken  to  help  to  ensure  the  success  of 
COP 21/CMP 11. Peru reported on the informal dialogue organized by the Government of 
Peru  in  Lima,  Peru,  from  20  to  22  March  2015,  while  France  reported  on  the  informal 
consultations on the preparation of COP 21 held in Paris, France, from 6 to 8 May 2015.8 In 

1  The report on the first and second parts of the second session of the ADP is contained in document 

FCCC/ADP/2013/2; the reports on the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth parts of the second 
session are contained in documents FCCC/ADP/2013/3, FCCC/ADP/2014/1, FCCC/ADP/2014/2, 
FCCC/ADP/2014/3, FCCC/ADP/2014/4 and FCCC/ADP/2015/2, respectively. 

2  The Bureau of the ADP was elected in accordance with the arrangement set out in document 

FCCC/ADP/2012/2, paragraph 7, which was endorsed by decision 2/CP.18. The ADP elected the 
current members of its Bureau at the seventh part of its second session, as reflected in document 
FCCC/ADP/2014/4.

the  Subsidiary  Body  for  Implementation,  Mr,  Amena  Yauvoli,  represented  by  the 
Rapporteur,  Mr.  Sidat  Yaffa,24  and  the  Chair  of  the  Subsidiary  Body  for  Scientific  and 
Technological Advice, Ms. Lidia Wojtal,25 were invited to update the ADP on agenda items 
of their subsidiary bodies related to the work of the ADP.  

14. 
The ADP contact group held an additional stocktaking meeting on 8 June to further 
assess the progress made during the session. At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs provided 
Parties with guidance for work at the remainder of the session. 

15.  At its 18th meeting, the ADP had before it the revised streamlined and consolidated 
text dated 11 June 2015, the working document of the same date, as well as the Co-Chairs’ 
suggestions on the way forward for the preparation of the tenth part of the session.26  

16.  At  the  same  meeting,  Parties  agreed  that  an  additional  tool  was  needed  for  the 
preparations  for  the  tenth  part  of  the  session.  They  requested  the  Co-Chairs,  with  the 
support  of  the  secretariat  and  the  co-facilitators,  to  make  available  to  Parties  “a  single 
document based on the structure of annex II to the scenario note of 5 May 2015, guided by 
the  views  expressed  by  Parties  during  the  8  June  stocktaking  meeting,  taking  fully  into 
account  the  discussions  in  the  75  meetings  of  the  ADP  negotiating  groups  as  well  as  the 
facilitation  groups.  It  will  include  a  fully  streamlined,  consolidated,  clear  and  concise 
version of the Geneva negotiating text27 that will present clear options and will not omit or 
delete  any  option  or  position  of  Parties.  It  will  separate  paragraphs  of  the  Geneva 
negotiating text that are, by their nature, obviously appropriate for inclusion in a draft COP 
decision from paragraphs that are, by their nature, obviously appropriate for inclusion in the 
Paris  agreement.  Issues  clearly  requiring  further  substantive  negotiation  among  Parties  to 
determine  their  placement  will  remain  in  the  streamlined,  consolidated,  clear  and  concise 
Geneva negotiating text without inclusion in either category and will be clearly identified.” 
In  order  to  further  advance  the  negotiations  on  workstream  2,  the  Co-Chairs  will  also

administrative  and  budgetary  implications  of,  and  on  the  status  of  funding  for,  holding 
additional sessions of the ADP in 2015. The Deputy Executive Secretary informed Parties 
that  there  is  an  outstanding  requirement  of  EUR  3.1  million  that  need  to  be  secured  in  a 
timely  manner  in  order  to  enable  the  participation  of  representatives  of  eligible  Parties  at 
the remaining sessions of the ADP and the COP in 2015. The Parties were further informed 
that EUR 100,000 is still required to complete the financing of the logistical arrangements

I.  Opening of the session 

(Agenda item 1) 

The ninth part of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the  Durban 
1. 
Platform  for  Enhanced  Action  (ADP)  was  held  at  the  World  Conference  Center  Bonn  in 
Bonn, Germany, from 1 to 11 June 2015.1 

The  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP,  Mr.  Ahmed  Djoghlaf  (non-Annex  I)  and  Mr.  Daniel 
2. 
Reifsnyder (Annex I), resumed the second session  of the ADP by opening its 17th plenary 
meeting on 1 June 2015. They welcomed all Parties and observers as well as Ms. Yang Liu 
(non-Annex I), Rapporteur of the ADP.2 

In order to advance the mandates and timelines agreed on at the seventeenth session 
3. 
of the Conference of the Parties (COP),3 as well as at COP 18,4 195 and 20,6 the Co-Chairs 
identified the objectives of the ninth part of the second session, namely to help to prepare a 
concise,  coherent  and  streamlined  negotiating  text  so  as  to  facilitate  negotiations  of 
substantive issues among Parties, and to provide the ADP with an opportunity to continue 
its efforts to facilitate pre-2020 climate action. 

4. 
Statements  were  made  by  representatives  of  14  Parties,  including  on  behalf  of  the 
Group  of  77  and  China,  the  Umbrella  Group,  the  European  Union  and  its  28  member 
States,  the  Environmental  Integrity  Group,  the  least  developed  countries,  the  African 
Group,  the  Alliance  of  Small  Island  States,  the  League  of  Arab  States,  the  Bolivarian 
Alliance  for  the  Peoples  of  Our  America  –  Peoples’  Trade  Treaty,  the  Independent 
Association for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Coalition for Rainforest Nations, the 
Like-minded  Developing  Countries,  the  BASIC  countries  (Brazil,  China,  India  and  South 
Africa),  and  the  Caribbean  Community.  Many  Parties  refrained  from  making  their 
statement in the room, choosing instead to make these available on the UNFCCC website, 
and thereby allowed the substantive negotiations to start without delay.7 

Also  at  the  17th  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  invited  the  Presidency  of  COP  20  and  the 
5. 
tenth session of the Conference of the  Parties serving as the  meeting of the Parties to the 
Kyoto Protocol (CMP), the incoming Presidency of COP 21/CMP 11 and other Parties to 
inform  delegates  of  initiatives  already  undertaken  to  help  to  ensure  the  success  of 
COP 21/CMP 11. Peru reported on the informal dialogue organized by the Government of 
Peru  in  Lima,  Peru,  from  20  to  22  March  2015,  while  France  reported  on  the  informal 
consultations on the preparation of COP 21 held in Paris, France, from 6 to 8 May 2015.8 In 

1  The report on the first and second parts of the second session of the ADP is contained in document 

FCCC/ADP/2013/2; the reports on the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth parts of the second 
session are contained in documents FCCC/ADP/2013/3, FCCC/ADP/2014/1, FCCC/ADP/2014/2, 
FCCC/ADP/2014/3, FCCC/ADP/2014/4 and FCCC/ADP/2015/2, respectively. 

2  The Bureau of the ADP was elected in accordance with the arrangement set out in document 

FCCC/ADP/2012/2, paragraph 7, which was endorsed by decision 2/CP.18. The ADP elected the 
current members of its Bureau at the seventh part of its second session, as reflected in document 
FCCC/ADP/2014/4.

addition,  Germany  reported  on  the  sixth  Petersberg  Climate  Dialogue  held  in  Berlin, 
Germany,  from 17  to  19 May 2015.9 Further, the  Co-Chairs thanked the  United States of 
America for giving them an opportunity to present their emerging ideas about the structure 
of  the  June  session  on  the  margins  of  the  Major  Economies  Forum  in  Washington,  D.C., 
United States, on 19 and 20 April 2015.

II.  Organizational matters 

(Agenda item 2) 

A.  Adoption of the agenda 

(Agenda item 2(b)) 

The  agenda  for  the  second  session  of  the  ADP  was  adopted  by  the  ADP  at  the 

6. 
1st meeting of the session, on 29 April 2013.10 

B.  Organization of the work of the session 

(Agenda item 2(c)) 

At the 17th meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the delegates’ attention to the scenario note 
7. 
prepared for the ninth part of the session,11 and to their further clarification on the method 
of work for the session.12 The proposed organization of the work on agenda item 3 included 
a contact group established at the fourth part of the session,13 as well as facilitated meetings 
on  specific  issues  in  the  sections  of  the  negotiating  text  and  workstream  2.  The  ADP 
proceeded on the basis of the proposed organization of work. 

In addition, the Co-Chairs informed Parties of their intention to hold a special event 

8. 
with observers during the session. This event took place on 10 June.14 

III.  Implementation of all the elements of decision 1/CP.17 

(Agenda item 3) 

The  ADP  considered  this  agenda  item  at  its  17th  meeting,  as  well  as  at  its  18th 
9. 
meeting,  held  on  11  June.  It  had  before  it  the  negotiating  text,15  the  informal  note16  on 
overlaps  and  duplication  in  that  negotiating  text,  the  scenario  note  prepared  for  the  ninth 
part of the session, two documents containing further clarification on the mode of work  of

10. 
Throughout the session, Party inputs to the negotiations as well as the outputs of the 
facilitated meetings were captured and made publicly available on the UNFCCC website.19 
This  resulted  in  multiple  iterations  of  both  a  working  document  and  a  streamlined  and 
consolidated text. These were also made available on the UNFCCC website.20 

11. 
In  the  context  of  work  on  pre-2020  climate  action,  including  on  how  to  further 
advance  workstream  2,  Parties  exchanged  views  in  the  contact  group  and  in  facilitated 
meetings. The output of these meetings has been posted on the UNFCCC website.21 

12. 
Such  work  was  accompanied  by  discussions  in  the  technical  expert  meetings  on 
renewable  energy  supply  convened  on  3  June22  and  on  energy  efficiency  in  urban 
environments  convened  on  5  and  6  June,23  facilitated  by  Mr.  Amit  Kumar  (India)  and 
Ms. Sylvie Lemmet (France), respectively.  

13.  On 4 June, the ADP contact group took stock of the progress of work. The Chair of 
the  Subsidiary  Body  for  Implementation,  Mr,  Amena  Yauvoli,  represented  by  the 
Rapporteur,  Mr.  Sidat  Yaffa,24  and  the  Chair  of  the  Subsidiary  Body  for  Scientific  and 
Technological Advice, Ms. Lidia Wojtal,25 were invited to update the ADP on agenda items 
of their subsidiary bodies related to the work of the ADP.  

14. 
The ADP contact group held an additional stocktaking meeting on 8 June to further 
assess the progress made during the session. At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs provided 
Parties with guidance for work at the remainder of the session. 

15.  At its 18th meeting, the ADP had before it the revised streamlined and consolidated 
text dated 11 June 2015, the working document of the same date, as well as the Co-Chairs’ 
suggestions on the way forward for the preparation of the tenth part of the session.26  

16.  At  the  same  meeting,  Parties  agreed  that  an  additional  tool  was  needed  for  the 
preparations  for  the  tenth  part  of  the  session.  They  requested  the  Co-Chairs,  with  the 
support  of  the  secretariat  and  the  co-facilitators,  to  make  available  to  Parties  “a  single 
document based on the structure of annex II to the scenario note of 5 May 2015, guided by 
the  views  expressed  by  Parties  during  the  8  June  stocktaking  meeting,  taking  fully  into 
account  the  discussions  in  the  75  meetings  of  the  ADP  negotiating  groups  as  well  as  the 
facilitation  groups.  It  will  include  a  fully  streamlined,  consolidated,  clear  and  concise 
version of the Geneva negotiating text27 that will present clear options and will not omit or 
delete  any  option  or  position  of  Parties.  It  will  separate  paragraphs  of  the  Geneva 
negotiating text that are, by their nature, obviously appropriate for inclusion in a draft COP 
decision from paragraphs that are, by their nature, obviously appropriate for inclusion in the 
Paris  agreement.  Issues  clearly  requiring  further  substantive  negotiation  among  Parties  to 
determine  their  placement  will  remain  in  the  streamlined,  consolidated,  clear  and  concise

I.  Opening of the session 

(Agenda item 1) 

The ninth part of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the  Durban 
1. 
Platform  for  Enhanced  Action  (ADP)  was  held  at  the  World  Conference  Center  Bonn  in 
Bonn, Germany, from 1 to 11 June 2015.1 

The  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP,  Mr.  Ahmed  Djoghlaf  (non-Annex  I)  and  Mr.  Daniel 
2. 
Reifsnyder (Annex I), resumed the second session  of the ADP by opening its 17th plenary 
meeting on 1 June 2015. They welcomed all Parties and observers as well as Ms. Yang Liu 
(non-Annex I), Rapporteur of the ADP.2 

In order to advance the mandates and timelines agreed on at the seventeenth session 
3. 
of the Conference of the Parties (COP),3 as well as at COP 18,4 195 and 20,6 the Co-Chairs 
identified the objectives of the ninth part of the second session, namely to help to prepare a 
concise,  coherent  and  streamlined  negotiating  text  so  as  to  facilitate  negotiations  of 
substantive issues among Parties, and to provide the ADP with an opportunity to continue 
its efforts to facilitate pre-2020 climate action. 

4. 
Statements  were  made  by  representatives  of  14  Parties,  including  on  behalf  of  the 
Group  of  77  and  China,  the  Umbrella  Group,  the  European  Union  and  its  28  member 
States,  the  Environmental  Integrity  Group,  the  least  developed  countries,  the  African 
Group,  the  Alliance  of  Small  Island  States,  the  League  of  Arab  States,  the  Bolivarian 
Alliance  for  the  Peoples  of  Our  America  –  Peoples’  Trade  Treaty,  the  Independent 
Association for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Coalition for Rainforest Nations, the 
Like-minded  Developing  Countries,  the  BASIC  countries  (Brazil,  China,  India  and  South 
Africa),  and  the  Caribbean  Community.  Many  Parties  refrained  from  making  their 
statement in the room, choosing instead to make these available on the UNFCCC website, 
and thereby allowed the substantive negotiations to start without delay.7 

Also  at  the  17th  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  invited  the  Presidency  of  COP  20  and  the 
5. 
tenth session of the Conference of the  Parties serving as the  meeting of the Parties to the 
Kyoto Protocol (CMP), the incoming Presidency of COP 21/CMP 11 and other Parties to 
inform  delegates  of  initiatives  already  undertaken  to  help  to  ensure  the  success  of 
COP 21/CMP 11. Peru reported on the informal dialogue organized by the Government of 
Peru  in  Lima,  Peru,  from  20  to  22  March  2015,  while  France  reported  on  the  informal 
consultations on the preparation of COP 21 held in Paris, France, from 6 to 8 May 2015.8 In 

1  The report on the first and second parts of the second session of the ADP is contained in document 

FCCC/ADP/2013/2; the reports on the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth parts of the second 
session are contained in documents FCCC/ADP/2013/3, FCCC/ADP/2014/1, FCCC/ADP/2014/2, 
FCCC/ADP/2014/3, FCCC/ADP/2014/4 and FCCC/ADP/2015/2, respectively. 

2  The Bureau of the ADP was elected in accordance with the arrangement set out in document 

FCCC/ADP/2012/2, paragraph 7, which was endorsed by decision 2/CP.18. The ADP elected the 
current members of its Bureau at the seventh part of its second session, as reflected in document 
FCCC/ADP/2014/4.

addition,  Germany  reported  on  the  sixth  Petersberg  Climate  Dialogue  held  in  Berlin, 
Germany,  from 17  to  19 May 2015.9 Further, the  Co-Chairs thanked the  United States of 
America for giving them an opportunity to present their emerging ideas about the structure 
of  the  June  session  on  the  margins  of  the  Major  Economies  Forum  in  Washington,  D.C., 
United States, on 19 and 20 April 2015. 

FCCC/ADP/2015/3 

II.  Organizational matters 

(Agenda item 2) 

A.  Adoption of the agenda 

(Agenda item 2(b)) 

The  agenda  for  the  second  session  of  the  ADP  was  adopted  by  the  ADP  at  the 

6. 
1st meeting of the session, on 29 April 2013.10 

B.  Organization of the work of the session 

(Agenda item 2(c)) 

At the 17th meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the delegates’ attention to the scenario note 
7. 
prepared for the ninth part of the session,11 and to their further clarification on the method 
of work for the session.12 The proposed organization of the work on agenda item 3 included 
a contact group established at the fourth part of the session,13 as well as facilitated meetings 
on  specific  issues  in  the  sections  of  the  negotiating  text  and  workstream  2.  The  ADP 
proceeded on the basis of the proposed organization of work. 

In addition, the Co-Chairs informed Parties of their intention to hold a special event 

8. 
with observers during the session. This event took place on 10 June.14 

III.  Implementation of all the elements of decision 1/CP.17 

(Agenda item 3) 

The  ADP  considered  this  agenda  item  at  its  17th  meeting,  as  well  as  at  its  18th 
9. 
meeting,  held  on  11  June.  It  had  before  it  the  negotiating  text,15  the  informal  note16  on 
overlaps  and  duplication  in  that  negotiating  text,  the  scenario  note  prepared  for  the  ninth 
part of the session, two documents containing further clarification on the mode of work  of 
the session17 and the report of the ADP on the eighth part of its second session.18

10. 
Throughout the session, Party inputs to the negotiations as well as the outputs of the 
facilitated meetings were captured and made publicly available on the UNFCCC website.19 
This  resulted  in  multiple  iterations  of  both  a  working  document  and  a  streamlined  and 
consolidated text. These were also made available on the UNFCCC website.20 

11. 
In  the  context  of  work  on  pre-2020  climate  action,  including  on  how  to  further 
advance  workstream  2,  Parties  exchanged  views  in  the  contact  group  and  in  facilitated 
meetings. The output of these meetings has been posted on the UNFCCC website.21 

12. 
Such  work  was  accompanied  by  discussions  in  the  technical  expert  meetings  on 
renewable  energy  supply  convened  on  3  June22  and  on  energy  efficiency  in  urban 
environments  convened  on  5  and  6  June,23  facilitated  by  Mr.  Amit  Kumar  (India)  and 
Ms. Sylvie Lemmet (France), respectively.  

13.  On 4 June, the ADP contact group took stock of the progress of work. The Chair of 
the  Subsidiary  Body  for  Implementation,  Mr,  Amena  Yauvoli,  represented  by  the 
Rapporteur,  Mr.  Sidat  Yaffa,24  and  the  Chair  of  the  Subsidiary  Body  for  Scientific  and 
Technological Advice, Ms. Lidia Wojtal,25 were invited to update the ADP on agenda items 
of their subsidiary bodies related to the work of the ADP.  

14. 
The ADP contact group held an additional stocktaking meeting on 8 June to further 
assess the progress made during the session. At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs provided 
Parties with guidance for work at the remainder of the session. 

15.  At its 18th meeting, the ADP had before it the revised streamlined and consolidated 
text dated 11 June 2015, the working document of the same date, as well as the Co-Chairs’ 
suggestions on the way forward for the preparation of the tenth part of the session.26  

16.  At  the  same  meeting,  Parties  agreed  that  an  additional  tool  was  needed  for  the 
preparations  for  the  tenth  part  of  the  session.  They  requested  the  Co-Chairs,  with  the 
support  of  the  secretariat  and  the  co-facilitators,  to  make  available  to  Parties  “a  single 
document based on the structure of annex II to the scenario note of 5 May 2015, guided by 
the  views  expressed  by  Parties  during  the  8  June  stocktaking  meeting,  taking  fully  into 
account  the  discussions  in  the  75  meetings  of  the  ADP  negotiating  groups  as  well  as  the 
facilitation  groups.  It  will  include  a  fully  streamlined,  consolidated,  clear  and  concise 
version of the Geneva negotiating text27 that will present clear options and will not omit or 
delete  any  option  or  position  of  Parties.  It  will  separate  paragraphs  of  the  Geneva 
negotiating text that are, by their nature, obviously appropriate for inclusion in a draft COP 
decision from paragraphs that are, by their nature, obviously appropriate for inclusion in the 
Paris  agreement.  Issues  clearly  requiring  further  substantive  negotiation  among  Parties  to 
determine  their  placement  will  remain  in  the  streamlined,  consolidated,  clear  and  concise 
Geneva negotiating text without inclusion in either category and will be clearly identified.” 
In  order  to  further  advance  the  negotiations  on  workstream  2,  the  Co-Chairs  will  also

prepare a document with elements for a draft decision on workstream 2 of the ADP as a key 
piece of the package to be considered at the Paris Conference.  

17. 
The  Co-Chairs  invited  the  secretariat  to  provide  delegates  with  information  on  the 
administrative  and  budgetary  implications  of,  and  on  the  status  of  funding  for,  holding 
additional sessions of the ADP in 2015. The Deputy Executive Secretary informed Parties 
that  there  is  an  outstanding  requirement  of  EUR  3.1  million  that  need  to  be  secured  in  a 
timely  manner  in  order  to  enable  the  participation  of  representatives  of  eligible  Parties  at 
the remaining sessions of the ADP and the COP in 2015. The Parties were further informed 
that EUR 100,000 is still required to complete the financing of the logistical arrangements 
for the October session of the ADP. 

18. 
Closing statements were made on behalf of the Presidency of COP 20/CMP 10 and 
the  incoming  Presidency  of  COP  21/CMP  11.  In  addition,  three  Parties  made  statements 
available on the UNFCCC website, including on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, the 
European Union and its 28 member States and the African Group.28 

IV.  Report on the ninth part of the second session 

(Agenda item 5) 

19.  At  its  18th  meeting,  the  ADP  considered  and  adopted  the  draft  report  on  the  ninth 
part of its second session.29 At the same meeting, on a proposal of the Co-Chairs, the ADP 
authorized the Rapporteur to complete the report on the  ninth part of the session, with the 
assistance of the secretariat and under the guidance of the Co-Chairs. 

V.  Suspension of the session 

20.  At its 18th meeting, the ADP agreed on a proposal of the Co-Chairs to suspend the 
second session and resume it in August 2015 in Bonn at its tenth part. 

21.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP  expressed  their  appreciation  to 
Parties for their work and support, and declared the second session of the ADP suspended.

I.  Opening of the session 

(Agenda item 1) 

The ninth part of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the  Durban 
1. 
Platform  for  Enhanced  Action  (ADP)  was  held  at  the  World  Conference  Center  Bonn  in 
Bonn, Germany, from 1 to 11 June 2015.1 

The  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP,  Mr.  Ahmed  Djoghlaf  (non-Annex  I)  and  Mr.  Daniel 
2. 
Reifsnyder (Annex I), resumed the second session  of the ADP by opening its 17th plenary 
meeting on 1 June 2015. They welcomed all Parties and observers as well as Ms. Yang Liu 
(non-Annex I), Rapporteur of the ADP.2 

In order to advance the mandates and timelines agreed on at the seventeenth session 
3. 
of the Conference of the Parties (COP),3 as well as at COP 18,4 195 and 20,6 the Co-Chairs 
identified the objectives of the ninth part of the second session, namely to help to prepare a 
concise,  coherent  and  streamlined  negotiating  text  so  as  to  facilitate  negotiations  of 
substantive issues among Parties, and to provide the ADP with an opportunity to continue 
its efforts to facilitate pre-2020 climate action. 

4. 
Statements  were  made  by  representatives  of  14  Parties,  including  on  behalf  of  the 
Group  of  77  and  China,  the  Umbrella  Group,  the  European  Union  and  its  28  member 
States,  the  Environmental  Integrity  Group,  the  least  developed  countries,  the  African 
Group,  the  Alliance  of  Small  Island  States,  the  League  of  Arab  States,  the  Bolivarian 
Alliance  for  the  Peoples  of  Our  America  –  Peoples’  Trade  Treaty,  the  Independent 
Association for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Coalition for Rainforest Nations, the 
Like-minded  Developing  Countries,  the  BASIC  countries  (Brazil,  China,  India  and  South 
Africa),  and  the  Caribbean  Community.  Many  Parties  refrained  from  making  their 
statement in the room, choosing instead to make these available on the UNFCCC website, 
and thereby allowed the substantive negotiations to start without delay.7 

Also  at  the  17th  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  invited  the  Presidency  of  COP  20  and  the 
5. 
tenth session of the Conference of the  Parties serving as the  meeting of the Parties to the 
Kyoto Protocol (CMP), the incoming Presidency of COP 21/CMP 11 and other Parties to 
inform  delegates  of  initiatives  already  undertaken  to  help  to  ensure  the  success  of 
COP 21/CMP 11. Peru reported on the informal dialogue organized by the Government of 
Peru  in  Lima,  Peru,  from  20  to  22  March  2015,  while  France  reported  on  the  informal 
consultations on the preparation of COP 21 held in Paris, France, from 6 to 8 May 2015.8 In

6. 
1st meeting of the session, on 29 April 2013.10 

B.  Organization of the work of the session 

(Agenda item 2(c)) 

At the 17th meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the delegates’ attention to the scenario note 
7. 
prepared for the ninth part of the session,11 and to their further clarification on the method 
of work for the session.12 The proposed organization of the work on agenda item 3 included 
a contact group established at the fourth part of the session,13 as well as facilitated meetings

8. 
with observers during the session. This event took place on 10 June.14

10. 
Throughout the session, Party inputs to the negotiations as well as the outputs of the 
facilitated meetings were captured and made publicly available on the UNFCCC website.19 
This  resulted  in  multiple  iterations  of  both  a  working  document  and  a  streamlined  and 
consolidated text. These were also made available on the UNFCCC website.20 

11. 
In  the  context  of  work  on  pre-2020  climate  action,  including  on  how  to  further 
advance  workstream  2,  Parties  exchanged  views  in  the  contact  group  and  in  facilitated 
meetings. The output of these meetings has been posted on the UNFCCC website.21 

12. 
Such  work  was  accompanied  by  discussions  in  the  technical  expert  meetings  on 
renewable  energy  supply  convened  on  3  June22  and  on  energy  efficiency  in  urban 
environments  convened  on  5  and  6  June,23  facilitated  by  Mr.  Amit  Kumar  (India)  and 
Ms. Sylvie Lemmet (France), respectively.  

13.  On 4 June, the ADP contact group took stock of the progress of work. The Chair of 
the  Subsidiary  Body  for  Implementation,  Mr,  Amena  Yauvoli,  represented  by  the 
Rapporteur,  Mr.  Sidat  Yaffa,24  and  the  Chair  of  the  Subsidiary  Body  for  Scientific  and 
Technological Advice, Ms. Lidia Wojtal,25 were invited to update the ADP on agenda items 
of their subsidiary bodies related to the work of the ADP.  

14. 
The ADP contact group held an additional stocktaking meeting on 8 June to further 
assess the progress made during the session. At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs provided 
Parties with guidance for work at the remainder of the session. 

15.  At its 18th meeting, the ADP had before it the revised streamlined and consolidated 
text dated 11 June 2015, the working document of the same date, as well as the Co-Chairs’ 
suggestions on the way forward for the preparation of the tenth part of the session.26  

16.  At  the  same  meeting,  Parties  agreed  that  an  additional  tool  was  needed  for  the 
preparations  for  the  tenth  part  of  the  session.  They  requested  the  Co-Chairs,  with  the 
support  of  the  secretariat  and  the  co-facilitators,  to  make  available  to  Parties  “a  single 
document based on the structure of annex II to the scenario note of 5 May 2015, guided by 
the  views  expressed  by  Parties  during  the  8  June  stocktaking  meeting,  taking  fully  into 
account  the  discussions  in  the  75  meetings  of  the  ADP  negotiating  groups  as  well  as  the 
facilitation  groups.  It  will  include  a  fully  streamlined,  consolidated,  clear  and  concise 
version of the Geneva negotiating text27 that will present clear options and will not omit or 
delete  any  option  or  position  of  Parties.  It  will  separate  paragraphs  of  the  Geneva 
negotiating text that are, by their nature, obviously appropriate for inclusion in a draft COP 
decision from paragraphs that are, by their nature, obviously appropriate for inclusion in the 
Paris  agreement.  Issues  clearly  requiring  further  substantive  negotiation  among  Parties  to 
determine  their  placement  will  remain  in  the  streamlined,  consolidated,  clear  and  concise 
Geneva negotiating text without inclusion in either category and will be clearly identified.” 
In  order  to  further  advance  the  negotiations  on  workstream  2,  the  Co-Chairs  will  also

piece of the package to be considered at the Paris Conference.  

17. 
The  Co-Chairs  invited  the  secretariat  to  provide  delegates  with  information  on  the 
administrative  and  budgetary  implications  of,  and  on  the  status  of  funding  for,  holding 
additional sessions of the ADP in 2015. The Deputy Executive Secretary informed Parties 
that  there  is  an  outstanding  requirement  of  EUR  3.1  million  that  need  to  be  secured  in  a 
timely  manner  in  order  to  enable  the  participation  of  representatives  of  eligible  Parties  at 
the remaining sessions of the ADP and the COP in 2015. The Parties were further informed 
that EUR 100,000 is still required to complete the financing of the logistical arrangements 
for the October session of the ADP. 

18. 
Closing statements were made on behalf of the Presidency of COP 20/CMP 10 and 
the  incoming  Presidency  of  COP  21/CMP  11.  In  addition,  three  Parties  made  statements 
available on the UNFCCC website, including on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, the 
European Union and its 28 member States and the African Group.28 

IV.  Report on the ninth part of the second session 

(Agenda item 5) 

19.  At  its  18th  meeting,  the  ADP  considered  and  adopted  the  draft  report  on  the  ninth 
part of its second session.29 At the same meeting, on a proposal of the Co-Chairs, the ADP 
authorized the Rapporteur to complete the report on the  ninth part of the session, with the 
assistance of the secretariat and under the guidance of the Co-Chairs. 

V.  Suspension of the session 

20.  At its 18th meeting, the ADP agreed on a proposal of the Co-Chairs to suspend the 
second session and resume it in August 2015 in Bonn at its tenth part. 

21.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP  expressed  their  appreciation  to 
Parties for their work and support, and declared the second session of the ADP suspended.

10. 
Throughout the session, Party inputs to the negotiations as well as the outputs of the 
facilitated meetings were captured and made publicly available on the UNFCCC website.19 
This  resulted  in  multiple  iterations  of  both  a  working  document  and  a  streamlined  and 
consolidated text. These were also made available on the UNFCCC website.20 

11. 
In  the  context  of  work  on  pre-2020  climate  action,  including  on  how  to  further 
advance  workstream  2,  Parties  exchanged  views  in  the  contact  group  and  in  facilitated 
meetings. The output of these meetings has been posted on the UNFCCC website.21 

12. 
Such  work  was  accompanied  by  discussions  in  the  technical  expert  meetings  on 
renewable  energy  supply  convened  on  3  June22  and  on  energy  efficiency  in  urban 
environments  convened  on  5  and  6  June,23  facilitated  by  Mr.  Amit  Kumar  (India)  and 
Ms. Sylvie Lemmet (France), respectively.  

13.  On 4 June, the ADP contact group took stock of the progress of work. The Chair of 
the  Subsidiary  Body  for  Implementation,  Mr,  Amena  Yauvoli,  represented  by  the 
Rapporteur,  Mr.  Sidat  Yaffa,24  and  the  Chair  of  the  Subsidiary  Body  for  Scientific  and 
Technological Advice, Ms. Lidia Wojtal,25 were invited to update the ADP on agenda items 
of their subsidiary bodies related to the work of the ADP.  

14. 
The ADP contact group held an additional stocktaking meeting on 8 June to further 
assess the progress made during the session. At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs provided 
Parties with guidance for work at the remainder of the session. 

15.  At its 18th meeting, the ADP had before it the revised streamlined and consolidated 
text dated 11 June 2015, the working document of the same date, as well as the Co-Chairs’ 
suggestions on the way forward for the preparation of the tenth part of the session.26  

16.  At  the  same  meeting,  Parties  agreed  that  an  additional  tool  was  needed  for  the 
preparations  for  the  tenth  part  of  the  session.  They  requested  the  Co-Chairs,  with  the 
support  of  the  secretariat  and  the  co-facilitators,  to  make  available  to  Parties  “a  single 
document based on the structure of annex II to the scenario note of 5 May 2015, guided by 
the  views  expressed  by  Parties  during  the  8  June  stocktaking  meeting,  taking  fully  into 
account  the  discussions  in  the  75  meetings  of  the  ADP  negotiating  groups  as  well  as  the 
facilitation  groups.  It  will  include  a  fully  streamlined,  consolidated,  clear  and  concise 
version of the Geneva negotiating text27 that will present clear options and will not omit or 
delete  any  option  or  position  of  Parties.  It  will  separate  paragraphs  of  the  Geneva 
negotiating text that are, by their nature, obviously appropriate for inclusion in a draft COP 
decision from paragraphs that are, by their nature, obviously appropriate for inclusion in the 
Paris  agreement.  Issues  clearly  requiring  further  substantive  negotiation  among  Parties  to 
determine  their  placement  will  remain  in  the  streamlined,  consolidated,  clear  and  concise 
Geneva negotiating text without inclusion in either category and will be clearly identified.” 
In  order  to  further  advance  the  negotiations  on  workstream  2,  the  Co-Chairs  will  also

piece of the package to be considered at the Paris Conference.  

17. 
The  Co-Chairs  invited  the  secretariat  to  provide  delegates  with  information  on  the 
administrative  and  budgetary  implications  of,  and  on  the  status  of  funding  for,  holding 
additional sessions of the ADP in 2015. The Deputy Executive Secretary informed Parties 
that  there  is  an  outstanding  requirement  of  EUR  3.1  million  that  need  to  be  secured  in  a 
timely  manner  in  order  to  enable  the  participation  of  representatives  of  eligible  Parties  at 
the remaining sessions of the ADP and the COP in 2015. The Parties were further informed 
that EUR 100,000 is still required to complete the financing of the logistical arrangements 
for the October session of the ADP. 

18. 
Closing statements were made on behalf of the Presidency of COP 20/CMP 10 and 
the  incoming  Presidency  of  COP  21/CMP  11.  In  addition,  three  Parties  made  statements 
available on the UNFCCC website, including on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, the 
European Union and its 28 member States and the African Group.28 

IV.  Report on the ninth part of the second session 

(Agenda item 5) 

19.  At  its  18th  meeting,  the  ADP  considered  and  adopted  the  draft  report  on  the  ninth 
part of its second session.29 At the same meeting, on a proposal of the Co-Chairs, the ADP 
authorized the Rapporteur to complete the report on the  ninth part of the session, with the 
assistance of the secretariat and under the guidance of the Co-Chairs. 

V.  Suspension of the session 

20.  At its 18th meeting, the ADP agreed on a proposal of the Co-Chairs to suspend the 
second session and resume it in August 2015 in Bonn at its tenth part.

I.  Opening of the session 

(Agenda item 1) 

The ninth part of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the  Durban 
1. 
Platform  for  Enhanced  Action  (ADP)  was  held  at  the  World  Conference  Center  Bonn  in 
Bonn, Germany, from 1 to 11 June 2015.1 

The  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP,  Mr.  Ahmed  Djoghlaf  (non-Annex  I)  and  Mr.  Daniel 
2. 
Reifsnyder (Annex I), resumed the second session  of the ADP by opening its 17th plenary 
meeting on 1 June 2015. They welcomed all Parties and observers as well as Ms. Yang Liu 
(non-Annex I), Rapporteur of the ADP.2 

In order to advance the mandates and timelines agreed on at the seventeenth session 
3. 
of the Conference of the Parties (COP),3 as well as at COP 18,4 195 and 20,6 the Co-Chairs 
identified the objectives of the ninth part of the second session, namely to help to prepare a 
concise,  coherent  and  streamlined  negotiating  text  so  as  to  facilitate  negotiations  of 
substantive issues among Parties, and to provide the ADP with an opportunity to continue 
its efforts to facilitate pre-2020 climate action. 

4. 
Statements  were  made  by  representatives  of  14  Parties,  including  on  behalf  of  the 
Group  of  77  and  China,  the  Umbrella  Group,  the  European  Union  and  its  28  member 
States,  the  Environmental  Integrity  Group,  the  least  developed  countries,  the  African 
Group,  the  Alliance  of  Small  Island  States,  the  League  of  Arab  States,  the  Bolivarian 
Alliance  for  the  Peoples  of  Our  America  –  Peoples’  Trade  Treaty,  the  Independent 
Association for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Coalition for Rainforest Nations, the 
Like-minded  Developing  Countries,  the  BASIC  countries  (Brazil,  China,  India  and  South 
Africa),  and  the  Caribbean  Community.  Many  Parties  refrained  from  making  their 
statement in the room, choosing instead to make these available on the UNFCCC website, 
and thereby allowed the substantive negotiations to start without delay.7 

Also  at  the  17th  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  invited  the  Presidency  of  COP  20  and  the 
5. 
tenth session of the Conference of the  Parties serving as the  meeting of the Parties to the 
Kyoto Protocol (CMP), the incoming Presidency of COP 21/CMP 11 and other Parties to 
inform  delegates  of  initiatives  already  undertaken  to  help  to  ensure  the  success  of 
COP 21/CMP 11. Peru reported on the informal dialogue organized by the Government of 
Peru  in  Lima,  Peru,  from  20  to  22  March  2015,  while  France  reported  on  the  informal 
consultations on the preparation of COP 21 held in Paris, France, from 6 to 8 May 2015.8 In 

1  The report on the first and second parts of the second session of the ADP is contained in document 

FCCC/ADP/2013/2; the reports on the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth parts of the second 
session are contained in documents FCCC/ADP/2013/3, FCCC/ADP/2014/1, FCCC/ADP/2014/2, 
FCCC/ADP/2014/3, FCCC/ADP/2014/4 and FCCC/ADP/2015/2, respectively. 

2  The Bureau of the ADP was elected in accordance with the arrangement set out in document 

FCCC/ADP/2012/2, paragraph 7, which was endorsed by decision 2/CP.18. The ADP elected the 
current members of its Bureau at the seventh part of its second session, as reflected in document 
FCCC/ADP/2014/4.

suggestions on the way forward for the preparation of the tenth part of the session.26  

16.  At  the  same  meeting,  Parties  agreed  that  an  additional  tool  was  needed  for  the 
preparations  for  the  tenth  part  of  the  session.  They  requested  the  Co-Chairs,  with  the 
support  of  the  secretariat  and  the  co-facilitators,  to  make  available  to  Parties  “a  single 
document based on the structure of annex II to the scenario note of 5 May 2015, guided by 
the  views  expressed  by  Parties  during  the  8  June  stocktaking  meeting,  taking  fully  into 
account  the  discussions  in  the  75  meetings  of  the  ADP  negotiating  groups  as  well  as  the 
facilitation  groups.  It  will  include  a  fully  streamlined,  consolidated,  clear  and  concise 
version of the Geneva negotiating text27 that will present clear options and will not omit or 
delete  any  option  or  position  of  Parties.  It  will  separate  paragraphs  of  the  Geneva 
negotiating text that are, by their nature, obviously appropriate for inclusion in a draft COP 
decision from paragraphs that are, by their nature, obviously appropriate for inclusion in the 
Paris  agreement.  Issues  clearly  requiring  further  substantive  negotiation  among  Parties  to 
determine  their  placement  will  remain  in  the  streamlined,  consolidated,  clear  and  concise 
Geneva negotiating text without inclusion in either category and will be clearly identified.” 
In  order  to  further  advance  the  negotiations  on  workstream  2,  the  Co-Chairs  will  also

I.  Opening of the session 

(Agenda item 1) 

The ninth part of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the  Durban 
1. 
Platform  for  Enhanced  Action  (ADP)  was  held  at  the  World  Conference  Center  Bonn  in 
Bonn, Germany, from 1 to 11 June 2015.1 

The  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP,  Mr.  Ahmed  Djoghlaf  (non-Annex  I)  and  Mr.  Daniel 
2. 
Reifsnyder (Annex I), resumed the second session  of the ADP by opening its 17th plenary 
meeting on 1 June 2015. They welcomed all Parties and observers as well as Ms. Yang Liu 
(non-Annex I), Rapporteur of the ADP.2 

In order to advance the mandates and timelines agreed on at the seventeenth session 
3. 
of the Conference of the Parties (COP),3 as well as at COP 18,4 195 and 20,6 the Co-Chairs 
identified the objectives of the ninth part of the second session, namely to help to prepare a 
concise,  coherent  and  streamlined  negotiating  text  so  as  to  facilitate  negotiations  of 
substantive issues among Parties, and to provide the ADP with an opportunity to continue 
its efforts to facilitate pre-2020 climate action. 

4. 
Statements  were  made  by  representatives  of  14  Parties,  including  on  behalf  of  the 
Group  of  77  and  China,  the  Umbrella  Group,  the  European  Union  and  its  28  member 
States,  the  Environmental  Integrity  Group,  the  least  developed  countries,  the  African 
Group,  the  Alliance  of  Small  Island  States,  the  League  of  Arab  States,  the  Bolivarian 
Alliance  for  the  Peoples  of  Our  America  –  Peoples’  Trade  Treaty,  the  Independent 
Association for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Coalition for Rainforest Nations, the 
Like-minded  Developing  Countries,  the  BASIC  countries  (Brazil,  China,  India  and  South 
Africa),  and  the  Caribbean  Community.  Many  Parties  refrained  from  making  their 
statement in the room, choosing instead to make these available on the UNFCCC website, 
and thereby allowed the substantive negotiations to start without delay.7 

Also  at  the  17th  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  invited  the  Presidency  of  COP  20  and  the 
5. 
tenth session of the Conference of the  Parties serving as the  meeting of the Parties to the 
Kyoto Protocol (CMP), the incoming Presidency of COP 21/CMP 11 and other Parties to 
inform  delegates  of  initiatives  already  undertaken  to  help  to  ensure  the  success  of 
COP 21/CMP 11. Peru reported on the informal dialogue organized by the Government of 
Peru  in  Lima,  Peru,  from  20  to  22  March  2015,  while  France  reported  on  the  informal 
consultations on the preparation of COP 21 held in Paris, France, from 6 to 8 May 2015.8 In 

1  The report on the first and second parts of the second session of the ADP is contained in document 

FCCC/ADP/2013/2; the reports on the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth parts of the second 
session are contained in documents FCCC/ADP/2013/3, FCCC/ADP/2014/1, FCCC/ADP/2014/2, 
FCCC/ADP/2014/3, FCCC/ADP/2014/4 and FCCC/ADP/2015/2, respectively. 

2  The Bureau of the ADP was elected in accordance with the arrangement set out in document 

FCCC/ADP/2012/2, paragraph 7, which was endorsed by decision 2/CP.18. The ADP elected the 
current members of its Bureau at the seventh part of its second session, as reflected in document 
FCCC/ADP/2014/4.

addition,  Germany  reported  on  the  sixth  Petersberg  Climate  Dialogue  held  in  Berlin, 
Germany,  from 17  to  19 May 2015.9 Further, the  Co-Chairs thanked the  United States of 
America for giving them an opportunity to present their emerging ideas about the structure 
of  the  June  session  on  the  margins  of  the  Major  Economies  Forum  in  Washington,  D.C., 
United States, on 19 and 20 April 2015.

II.  Organizational matters 

(Agenda item 2) 

A.  Adoption of the agenda 

(Agenda item 2(b)) 

The  agenda  for  the  second  session  of  the  ADP  was  adopted  by  the  ADP  at  the 

6. 
1st meeting of the session, on 29 April 2013.10 

B.  Organization of the work of the session 

(Agenda item 2(c)) 

At the 17th meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the delegates’ attention to the scenario note 
7. 
prepared for the ninth part of the session,11 and to their further clarification on the method 
of work for the session.12 The proposed organization of the work on agenda item 3 included 
a contact group established at the fourth part of the session,13 as well as facilitated meetings 
on  specific  issues  in  the  sections  of  the  negotiating  text  and  workstream  2.  The  ADP 
proceeded on the basis of the proposed organization of work. 

In addition, the Co-Chairs informed Parties of their intention to hold a special event 

8. 
with observers during the session. This event took place on 10 June.14 

III.  Implementation of all the elements of decision 1/CP.17 

(Agenda item 3) 

The  ADP  considered  this  agenda  item  at  its  17th  meeting,  as  well  as  at  its  18th 
9. 
meeting,  held  on  11  June.  It  had  before  it  the  negotiating  text,15  the  informal  note16  on 
overlaps  and  duplication  in  that  negotiating  text,  the  scenario  note  prepared  for  the  ninth 
part of the session, two documents containing further clarification on the mode of work  of

10. 
Throughout the session, Party inputs to the negotiations as well as the outputs of the 
facilitated meetings were captured and made publicly available on the UNFCCC website.19 
This  resulted  in  multiple  iterations  of  both  a  working  document  and  a  streamlined  and 
consolidated text. These were also made available on the UNFCCC website.20 

11. 
In  the  context  of  work  on  pre-2020  climate  action,  including  on  how  to  further 
advance  workstream  2,  Parties  exchanged  views  in  the  contact  group  and  in  facilitated 
meetings. The output of these meetings has been posted on the UNFCCC website.21 

12. 
Such  work  was  accompanied  by  discussions  in  the  technical  expert  meetings  on 
renewable  energy  supply  convened  on  3  June22  and  on  energy  efficiency  in  urban 
environments  convened  on  5  and  6  June,23  facilitated  by  Mr.  Amit  Kumar  (India)  and 
Ms. Sylvie Lemmet (France), respectively.  

13.  On 4 June, the ADP contact group took stock of the progress of work. The Chair of 
the  Subsidiary  Body  for  Implementation,  Mr,  Amena  Yauvoli,  represented  by  the 
Rapporteur,  Mr.  Sidat  Yaffa,24  and  the  Chair  of  the  Subsidiary  Body  for  Scientific  and 
Technological Advice, Ms. Lidia Wojtal,25 were invited to update the ADP on agenda items 
of their subsidiary bodies related to the work of the ADP.  

14. 
The ADP contact group held an additional stocktaking meeting on 8 June to further 
assess the progress made during the session. At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs provided 
Parties with guidance for work at the remainder of the session. 

15.  At its 18th meeting, the ADP had before it the revised streamlined and consolidated 
text dated 11 June 2015, the working document of the same date, as well as the Co-Chairs’ 
suggestions on the way forward for the preparation of the tenth part of the session.26  

16.  At  the  same  meeting,  Parties  agreed  that  an  additional  tool  was  needed  for  the 
preparations  for  the  tenth  part  of  the  session.  They  requested  the  Co-Chairs,  with  the 
support  of  the  secretariat  and  the  co-facilitators,  to  make  available  to  Parties  “a  single 
document based on the structure of annex II to the scenario note of 5 May 2015, guided by 
the  views  expressed  by  Parties  during  the  8  June  stocktaking  meeting,  taking  fully  into 
account  the  discussions  in  the  75  meetings  of  the  ADP  negotiating  groups  as  well  as  the 
facilitation  groups.  It  will  include  a  fully  streamlined,  consolidated,  clear  and  concise 
version of the Geneva negotiating text27 that will present clear options and will not omit or 
delete  any  option  or  position  of  Parties.  It  will  separate  paragraphs  of  the  Geneva 
negotiating text that are, by their nature, obviously appropriate for inclusion in a draft COP 
decision from paragraphs that are, by their nature, obviously appropriate for inclusion in the 
Paris  agreement.  Issues  clearly  requiring  further  substantive  negotiation  among  Parties  to 
determine  their  placement  will  remain  in  the  streamlined,  consolidated,  clear  and  concise 
Geneva negotiating text without inclusion in either category and will be clearly identified.”

I.  Opening of the session 

(Agenda item 1) 

The ninth part of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the  Durban 
1. 
Platform  for  Enhanced  Action  (ADP)  was  held  at  the  World  Conference  Center  Bonn  in 
Bonn, Germany, from 1 to 11 June 2015.1 

The  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP,  Mr.  Ahmed  Djoghlaf  (non-Annex  I)  and  Mr.  Daniel 
2. 
Reifsnyder (Annex I), resumed the second session  of the ADP by opening its 17th plenary 
meeting on 1 June 2015. They welcomed all Parties and observers as well as Ms. Yang Liu 
(non-Annex I), Rapporteur of the ADP.2 

In order to advance the mandates and timelines agreed on at the seventeenth session 
3. 
of the Conference of the Parties (COP),3 as well as at COP 18,4 195 and 20,6 the Co-Chairs 
identified the objectives of the ninth part of the second session, namely to help to prepare a 
concise,  coherent  and  streamlined  negotiating  text  so  as  to  facilitate  negotiations  of 
substantive issues among Parties, and to provide the ADP with an opportunity to continue 
its efforts to facilitate pre-2020 climate action. 

4. 
Statements  were  made  by  representatives  of  14  Parties,  including  on  behalf  of  the 
Group  of  77  and  China,  the  Umbrella  Group,  the  European  Union  and  its  28  member 
States,  the  Environmental  Integrity  Group,  the  least  developed  countries,  the  African 
Group,  the  Alliance  of  Small  Island  States,  the  League  of  Arab  States,  the  Bolivarian 
Alliance  for  the  Peoples  of  Our  America  –  Peoples’  Trade  Treaty,  the  Independent 
Association for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Coalition for Rainforest Nations, the 
Like-minded  Developing  Countries,  the  BASIC  countries  (Brazil,  China,  India  and  South 
Africa),  and  the  Caribbean  Community.  Many  Parties  refrained  from  making  their 
statement in the room, choosing instead to make these available on the UNFCCC website, 
and thereby allowed the substantive negotiations to start without delay.7 

Also  at  the  17th  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  invited  the  Presidency  of  COP  20  and  the 
5. 
tenth session of the Conference of the  Parties serving as the  meeting of the Parties to the 
Kyoto Protocol (CMP), the incoming Presidency of COP 21/CMP 11 and other Parties to 
inform  delegates  of  initiatives  already  undertaken  to  help  to  ensure  the  success  of 
COP 21/CMP 11. Peru reported on the informal dialogue organized by the Government of 
Peru  in  Lima,  Peru,  from  20  to  22  March  2015,  while  France  reported  on  the  informal 
consultations on the preparation of COP 21 held in Paris, France, from 6 to 8 May 2015.8 In 

1  The report on the first and second parts of the second session of the ADP is contained in document 

FCCC/ADP/2013/2; the reports on the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth parts of the second 
session are contained in documents FCCC/ADP/2013/3, FCCC/ADP/2014/1, FCCC/ADP/2014/2, 
FCCC/ADP/2014/3, FCCC/ADP/2014/4 and FCCC/ADP/2015/2, respectively. 

2  The Bureau of the ADP was elected in accordance with the arrangement set out in document 

FCCC/ADP/2012/2, paragraph 7, which was endorsed by decision 2/CP.18. The ADP elected the 
current members of its Bureau at the seventh part of its second session, as reflected in document 
FCCC/ADP/2014/4. 

3  Decision 1/CP.17, paragraph 2. 
4  Decision 1/CP.18, paragraph 4.

addition,  Germany  reported  on  the  sixth  Petersberg  Climate  Dialogue  held  in  Berlin, 
Germany,  from 17  to  19 May 2015.9 Further, the  Co-Chairs thanked the  United States of 
America for giving them an opportunity to present their emerging ideas about the structure 
of  the  June  session  on  the  margins  of  the  Major  Economies  Forum  in  Washington,  D.C., 
United States, on 19 and 20 April 2015. 

FCCC/ADP/2015/3 

II.  Organizational matters 

(Agenda item 2) 

A.  Adoption of the agenda 

(Agenda item 2(b)) 

The  agenda  for  the  second  session  of  the  ADP  was  adopted  by  the  ADP  at  the 

6. 
1st meeting of the session, on 29 April 2013.10 

B.  Organization of the work of the session 

(Agenda item 2(c)) 

At the 17th meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the delegates’ attention to the scenario note 
7. 
prepared for the ninth part of the session,11 and to their further clarification on the method 
of work for the session.12 The proposed organization of the work on agenda item 3 included 
a contact group established at the fourth part of the session,13 as well as facilitated meetings 
on  specific  issues  in  the  sections  of  the  negotiating  text  and  workstream  2.  The  ADP 
proceeded on the basis of the proposed organization of work. 

In addition, the Co-Chairs informed Parties of their intention to hold a special event 

8. 
with observers during the session. This event took place on 10 June.14 

III.  Implementation of all the elements of decision 1/CP.17 

(Agenda item 3) 

The  ADP  considered  this  agenda  item  at  its  17th  meeting,  as  well  as  at  its  18th 
9. 
meeting,  held  on  11  June.  It  had  before  it  the  negotiating  text,15  the  informal  note16  on 
overlaps  and  duplication  in  that  negotiating  text,  the  scenario  note  prepared  for  the  ninth 
part of the session, two documents containing further clarification on the mode of work  of 
the session17 and the report of the ADP on the eighth part of its second session.18

10. 
Throughout the session, Party inputs to the negotiations as well as the outputs of the 
facilitated meetings were captured and made publicly available on the UNFCCC website.19 
This  resulted  in  multiple  iterations  of  both  a  working  document  and  a  streamlined  and 
consolidated text. These were also made available on the UNFCCC website.20 

11. 
In  the  context  of  work  on  pre-2020  climate  action,  including  on  how  to  further 
advance  workstream  2,  Parties  exchanged  views  in  the  contact  group  and  in  facilitated 
meetings. The output of these meetings has been posted on the UNFCCC website.21 

12. 
Such  work  was  accompanied  by  discussions  in  the  technical  expert  meetings  on 
renewable  energy  supply  convened  on  3  June22  and  on  energy  efficiency  in  urban 
environments  convened  on  5  and  6  June,23  facilitated  by  Mr.  Amit  Kumar  (India)  and 
Ms. Sylvie Lemmet (France), respectively.  

13.  On 4 June, the ADP contact group took stock of the progress of work. The Chair of 
the  Subsidiary  Body  for  Implementation,  Mr,  Amena  Yauvoli,  represented  by  the 
Rapporteur,  Mr.  Sidat  Yaffa,24  and  the  Chair  of  the  Subsidiary  Body  for  Scientific  and 
Technological Advice, Ms. Lidia Wojtal,25 were invited to update the ADP on agenda items 
of their subsidiary bodies related to the work of the ADP.  

14. 
The ADP contact group held an additional stocktaking meeting on 8 June to further 
assess the progress made during the session. At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs provided 
Parties with guidance for work at the remainder of the session. 

15.  At its 18th meeting, the ADP had before it the revised streamlined and consolidated 
text dated 11 June 2015, the working document of the same date, as well as the Co-Chairs’ 
suggestions on the way forward for the preparation of the tenth part of the session.26  

16.  At  the  same  meeting,  Parties  agreed  that  an  additional  tool  was  needed  for  the 
preparations  for  the  tenth  part  of  the  session.  They  requested  the  Co-Chairs,  with  the 
support  of  the  secretariat  and  the  co-facilitators,  to  make  available  to  Parties  “a  single 
document based on the structure of annex II to the scenario note of 5 May 2015, guided by 
the  views  expressed  by  Parties  during  the  8  June  stocktaking  meeting,  taking  fully  into 
account  the  discussions  in  the  75  meetings  of  the  ADP  negotiating  groups  as  well  as  the 
facilitation  groups.  It  will  include  a  fully  streamlined,  consolidated,  clear  and  concise 
version of the Geneva negotiating text27 that will present clear options and will not omit or 
delete  any  option  or  position  of  Parties.  It  will  separate  paragraphs  of  the  Geneva 
negotiating text that are, by their nature, obviously appropriate for inclusion in a draft COP 
decision from paragraphs that are, by their nature, obviously appropriate for inclusion in the 
Paris  agreement.  Issues  clearly  requiring  further  substantive  negotiation  among  Parties  to 
determine  their  placement  will  remain  in  the  streamlined,  consolidated,  clear  and  concise 
Geneva negotiating text without inclusion in either category and will be clearly identified.” 
In  order  to  further  advance  the  negotiations  on  workstream  2,  the  Co-Chairs  will  also

prepare a document with elements for a draft decision on workstream 2 of the ADP as a key 
piece of the package to be considered at the Paris Conference.  

17. 
The  Co-Chairs  invited  the  secretariat  to  provide  delegates  with  information  on  the 
administrative  and  budgetary  implications  of,  and  on  the  status  of  funding  for,  holding 
additional sessions of the ADP in 2015. The Deputy Executive Secretary informed Parties 
that  there  is  an  outstanding  requirement  of  EUR  3.1  million  that  need  to  be  secured  in  a 
timely  manner  in  order  to  enable  the  participation  of  representatives  of  eligible  Parties  at 
the remaining sessions of the ADP and the COP in 2015. The Parties were further informed 
that EUR 100,000 is still required to complete the financing of the logistical arrangements 
for the October session of the ADP. 

18. 
Closing statements were made on behalf of the Presidency of COP 20/CMP 10 and 
the  incoming  Presidency  of  COP  21/CMP  11.  In  addition,  three  Parties  made  statements 
available on the UNFCCC website, including on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, the 
European Union and its 28 member States and the African Group.28 

IV.  Report on the ninth part of the second session 

(Agenda item 5) 

19.  At  its  18th  meeting,  the  ADP  considered  and  adopted  the  draft  report  on  the  ninth 
part of its second session.29 At the same meeting, on a proposal of the Co-Chairs, the ADP 
authorized the Rapporteur to complete the report on the  ninth part of the session, with the 
assistance of the secretariat and under the guidance of the Co-Chairs. 

V.  Suspension of the session 

20.  At its 18th meeting, the ADP agreed on a proposal of the Co-Chairs to suspend the 
second session and resume it in August 2015 in Bonn at its tenth part. 

21.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP  expressed  their  appreciation  to 
Parties for their work and support, and declared the second session of the ADP suspended.

I.  Opening of the session 

(Agenda item 1) 

The ninth part of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the  Durban 
1. 
Platform  for  Enhanced  Action  (ADP)  was  held  at  the  World  Conference  Center  Bonn  in 
Bonn, Germany, from 1 to 11 June 2015.1 

The  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP,  Mr.  Ahmed  Djoghlaf  (non-Annex  I)  and  Mr.  Daniel 
2. 
Reifsnyder (Annex I), resumed the second session  of the ADP by opening its 17th plenary 
meeting on 1 June 2015. They welcomed all Parties and observers as well as Ms. Yang Liu 
(non-Annex I), Rapporteur of the ADP.2 

In order to advance the mandates and timelines agreed on at the seventeenth session 
3. 
of the Conference of the Parties (COP),3 as well as at COP 18,4 195 and 20,6 the Co-Chairs 
identified the objectives of the ninth part of the second session, namely to help to prepare a 
concise,  coherent  and  streamlined  negotiating  text  so  as  to  facilitate  negotiations  of 
substantive issues among Parties, and to provide the ADP with an opportunity to continue 
its efforts to facilitate pre-2020 climate action. 

4. 
Statements  were  made  by  representatives  of  14  Parties,  including  on  behalf  of  the 
Group  of  77  and  China,  the  Umbrella  Group,  the  European  Union  and  its  28  member 
States,  the  Environmental  Integrity  Group,  the  least  developed  countries,  the  African 
Group,  the  Alliance  of  Small  Island  States,  the  League  of  Arab  States,  the  Bolivarian 
Alliance  for  the  Peoples  of  Our  America  –  Peoples’  Trade  Treaty,  the  Independent 
Association for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Coalition for Rainforest Nations, the 
Like-minded  Developing  Countries,  the  BASIC  countries  (Brazil,  China,  India  and  South 
Africa),  and  the  Caribbean  Community.  Many  Parties  refrained  from  making  their 
statement in the room, choosing instead to make these available on the UNFCCC website, 
and thereby allowed the substantive negotiations to start without delay.7 

Also  at  the  17th  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  invited  the  Presidency  of  COP  20  and  the 
5. 
tenth session of the Conference of the  Parties serving as the  meeting of the Parties to the 
Kyoto Protocol (CMP), the incoming Presidency of COP 21/CMP 11 and other Parties to 
inform  delegates  of  initiatives  already  undertaken  to  help  to  ensure  the  success  of 
COP 21/CMP 11. Peru reported on the informal dialogue organized by the Government of 
Peru  in  Lima,  Peru,  from  20  to  22  March  2015,  while  France  reported  on  the  informal 
consultations on the preparation of COP 21 held in Paris, France, from 6 to 8 May 2015.8 In

10. 
Throughout the session, Party inputs to the negotiations as well as the outputs of the 
facilitated meetings were captured and made publicly available on the UNFCCC website.19 
This  resulted  in  multiple  iterations  of  both  a  working  document  and  a  streamlined  and 
consolidated text. These were also made available on the UNFCCC website.20 

11. 
In  the  context  of  work  on  pre-2020  climate  action,  including  on  how  to  further 
advance  workstream  2,  Parties  exchanged  views  in  the  contact  group  and  in  facilitated 
meetings. The output of these meetings has been posted on the UNFCCC website.21 

12. 
Such  work  was  accompanied  by  discussions  in  the  technical  expert  meetings  on 
renewable  energy  supply  convened  on  3  June22  and  on  energy  efficiency  in  urban 
environments  convened  on  5  and  6  June,23  facilitated  by  Mr.  Amit  Kumar  (India)  and 
Ms. Sylvie Lemmet (France), respectively.  

13.  On 4 June, the ADP contact group took stock of the progress of work. The Chair of 
the  Subsidiary  Body  for  Implementation,  Mr,  Amena  Yauvoli,  represented  by  the 
Rapporteur,  Mr.  Sidat  Yaffa,24  and  the  Chair  of  the  Subsidiary  Body  for  Scientific  and 
Technological Advice, Ms. Lidia Wojtal,25 were invited to update the ADP on agenda items 
of their subsidiary bodies related to the work of the ADP.  

14. 
The ADP contact group held an additional stocktaking meeting on 8 June to further 
assess the progress made during the session. At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs provided 
Parties with guidance for work at the remainder of the session. 

15.  At its 18th meeting, the ADP had before it the revised streamlined and consolidated 
text dated 11 June 2015, the working document of the same date, as well as the Co-Chairs’ 
suggestions on the way forward for the preparation of the tenth part of the session.26  

16.  At  the  same  meeting,  Parties  agreed  that  an  additional  tool  was  needed  for  the 
preparations  for  the  tenth  part  of  the  session.  They  requested  the  Co-Chairs,  with  the 
support  of  the  secretariat  and  the  co-facilitators,  to  make  available  to  Parties  “a  single 
document based on the structure of annex II to the scenario note of 5 May 2015, guided by 
the  views  expressed  by  Parties  during  the  8  June  stocktaking  meeting,  taking  fully  into 
account  the  discussions  in  the  75  meetings  of  the  ADP  negotiating  groups  as  well  as  the 
facilitation  groups.  It  will  include  a  fully  streamlined,  consolidated,  clear  and  concise 
version of the Geneva negotiating text27 that will present clear options and will not omit or 
delete  any  option  or  position  of  Parties.  It  will  separate  paragraphs  of  the  Geneva 
negotiating text that are, by their nature, obviously appropriate for inclusion in a draft COP 
decision from paragraphs that are, by their nature, obviously appropriate for inclusion in the 
Paris  agreement.  Issues  clearly  requiring  further  substantive  negotiation  among  Parties  to 
determine  their  placement  will  remain  in  the  streamlined,  consolidated,  clear  and  concise 
Geneva negotiating text without inclusion in either category and will be clearly identified.” 
In  order  to  further  advance  the  negotiations  on  workstream  2,  the  Co-Chairs  will  also

prepare a document with elements for a draft decision on workstream 2 of the ADP as a key 
piece of the package to be considered at the Paris Conference.  

17. 
The  Co-Chairs  invited  the  secretariat  to  provide  delegates  with  information  on  the 
administrative  and  budgetary  implications  of,  and  on  the  status  of  funding  for,  holding 
additional sessions of the ADP in 2015. The Deputy Executive Secretary informed Parties 
that  there  is  an  outstanding  requirement  of  EUR  3.1  million  that  need  to  be  secured  in  a 
timely  manner  in  order  to  enable  the  participation  of  representatives  of  eligible  Parties  at 
the remaining sessions of the ADP and the COP in 2015. The Parties were further informed 
that EUR 100,000 is still required to complete the financing of the logistical arrangements 
for the October session of the ADP. 

18. 
Closing statements were made on behalf of the Presidency of COP 20/CMP 10 and 
the  incoming  Presidency  of  COP  21/CMP  11.  In  addition,  three  Parties  made  statements 
available on the UNFCCC website, including on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, the 
European Union and its 28 member States and the African Group.28 

IV.  Report on the ninth part of the second session 

(Agenda item 5) 

19.  At  its  18th  meeting,  the  ADP  considered  and  adopted  the  draft  report  on  the  ninth 
part of its second session.29 At the same meeting, on a proposal of the Co-Chairs, the ADP 
authorized the Rapporteur to complete the report on the  ninth part of the session, with the 
assistance of the secretariat and under the guidance of the Co-Chairs. 

V.  Suspension of the session 

20.  At its 18th meeting, the ADP agreed on a proposal of the Co-Chairs to suspend the 
second session and resume it in August 2015 in Bonn at its tenth part. 

21.  At  the  same  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP  expressed  their  appreciation  to 
Parties for their work and support, and declared the second session of the ADP suspended.

10. 
Throughout the session, Party inputs to the negotiations as well as the outputs of the 
facilitated meetings were captured and made publicly available on the UNFCCC website.19 
This  resulted  in  multiple  iterations  of  both  a  working  document  and  a  streamlined  and 
consolidated text. These were also made available on the UNFCCC website.20 

11. 
In  the  context  of  work  on  pre-2020  climate  action,  including  on  how  to  further 
advance  workstream  2,  Parties  exchanged  views  in  the  contact  group  and  in  facilitated 
meetings. The output of these meetings has been posted on the UNFCCC website.21 

12. 
Such  work  was  accompanied  by  discussions  in  the  technical  expert  meetings  on 
renewable  energy  supply  convened  on  3  June22  and  on  energy  efficiency  in  urban 
environments  convened  on  5  and  6  June,23  facilitated  by  Mr.  Amit  Kumar  (India)  and 
Ms. Sylvie Lemmet (France), respectively.  

13.  On 4 June, the ADP contact group took stock of the progress of work. The Chair of 
the  Subsidiary  Body  for  Implementation,  Mr,  Amena  Yauvoli,  represented  by  the 
Rapporteur,  Mr.  Sidat  Yaffa,24  and  the  Chair  of  the  Subsidiary  Body  for  Scientific  and 
Technological Advice, Ms. Lidia Wojtal,25 were invited to update the ADP on agenda items 
of their subsidiary bodies related to the work of the ADP.  

14. 
The ADP contact group held an additional stocktaking meeting on 8 June to further 
assess the progress made during the session. At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs provided 
Parties with guidance for work at the remainder of the session. 

15.  At its 18th meeting, the ADP had before it the revised streamlined and consolidated 
text dated 11 June 2015, the working document of the same date, as well as the Co-Chairs’ 
suggestions on the way forward for the preparation of the tenth part of the session.26  

16.  At  the  same  meeting,  Parties  agreed  that  an  additional  tool  was  needed  for  the 
preparations  for  the  tenth  part  of  the  session.  They  requested  the  Co-Chairs,  with  the 
support  of  the  secretariat  and  the  co-facilitators,  to  make  available  to  Parties  “a  single 
document based on the structure of annex II to the scenario note of 5 May 2015, guided by 
the  views  expressed  by  Parties  during  the  8  June  stocktaking  meeting,  taking  fully  into 
account  the  discussions  in  the  75  meetings  of  the  ADP  negotiating  groups  as  well  as  the 
facilitation  groups.  It  will  include  a  fully  streamlined,  consolidated,  clear  and  concise 
version of the Geneva negotiating text27 that will present clear options and will not omit or 
delete  any  option  or  position  of  Parties.  It  will  separate  paragraphs  of  the  Geneva 
negotiating text that are, by their nature, obviously appropriate for inclusion in a draft COP 
decision from paragraphs that are, by their nature, obviously appropriate for inclusion in the 
Paris  agreement.  Issues  clearly  requiring  further  substantive  negotiation  among  Parties  to 
determine  their  placement  will  remain  in  the  streamlined,  consolidated,  clear  and  concise 
Geneva negotiating text without inclusion in either category and will be clearly identified.” 
In  order  to  further  advance  the  negotiations  on  workstream  2,  the  Co-Chairs  will  also

17. 
The  Co-Chairs  invited  the  secretariat  to  provide  delegates  with  information  on  the 
administrative  and  budgetary  implications  of,  and  on  the  status  of  funding  for,  holding 
additional sessions of the ADP in 2015. The Deputy Executive Secretary informed Parties 
that  there  is  an  outstanding  requirement  of  EUR  3.1  million  that  need  to  be  secured  in  a 
timely  manner  in  order  to  enable  the  participation  of  representatives  of  eligible  Parties  at 
the remaining sessions of the ADP and the COP in 2015. The Parties were further informed 
that EUR 100,000 is still required to complete the financing of the logistical arrangements 
for the October session of the ADP.

assistance of the secretariat and under the guidance of the Co-Chairs.

I.  Opening of the session 

(Agenda item 1) 

The ninth part of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the  Durban 
1. 
Platform  for  Enhanced  Action  (ADP)  was  held  at  the  World  Conference  Center  Bonn  in 
Bonn, Germany, from 1 to 11 June 2015.1 

The  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP,  Mr.  Ahmed  Djoghlaf  (non-Annex  I)  and  Mr.  Daniel 
2. 
Reifsnyder (Annex I), resumed the second session  of the ADP by opening its 17th plenary 
meeting on 1 June 2015. They welcomed all Parties and observers as well as Ms. Yang Liu 
(non-Annex I), Rapporteur of the ADP.2 

In order to advance the mandates and timelines agreed on at the seventeenth session 
3. 
of the Conference of the Parties (COP),3 as well as at COP 18,4 195 and 20,6 the Co-Chairs 
identified the objectives of the ninth part of the second session, namely to help to prepare a 
concise,  coherent  and  streamlined  negotiating  text  so  as  to  facilitate  negotiations  of 
substantive issues among Parties, and to provide the ADP with an opportunity to continue 
its efforts to facilitate pre-2020 climate action. 

4. 
Statements  were  made  by  representatives  of  14  Parties,  including  on  behalf  of  the 
Group  of  77  and  China,  the  Umbrella  Group,  the  European  Union  and  its  28  member 
States,  the  Environmental  Integrity  Group,  the  least  developed  countries,  the  African 
Group,  the  Alliance  of  Small  Island  States,  the  League  of  Arab  States,  the  Bolivarian 
Alliance  for  the  Peoples  of  Our  America  –  Peoples’  Trade  Treaty,  the  Independent 
Association for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Coalition for Rainforest Nations, the 
Like-minded  Developing  Countries,  the  BASIC  countries  (Brazil,  China,  India  and  South 
Africa),  and  the  Caribbean  Community.  Many  Parties  refrained  from  making  their 
statement in the room, choosing instead to make these available on the UNFCCC website, 
and thereby allowed the substantive negotiations to start without delay.7 

Also  at  the  17th  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  invited  the  Presidency  of  COP  20  and  the 
5. 
tenth session of the Conference of the  Parties serving as the  meeting of the Parties to the 
Kyoto Protocol (CMP), the incoming Presidency of COP 21/CMP 11 and other Parties to 
inform  delegates  of  initiatives  already  undertaken  to  help  to  ensure  the  success  of 
COP 21/CMP 11. Peru reported on the informal dialogue organized by the Government of 
Peru  in  Lima,  Peru,  from  20  to  22  March  2015,  while  France  reported  on  the  informal 
consultations on the preparation of COP 21 held in Paris, France, from 6 to 8 May 2015.8 In 

1  The report on the first and second parts of the second session of the ADP is contained in document 

FCCC/ADP/2013/2; the reports on the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth parts of the second 
session are contained in documents FCCC/ADP/2013/3, FCCC/ADP/2014/1, FCCC/ADP/2014/2, 
FCCC/ADP/2014/3, FCCC/ADP/2014/4 and FCCC/ADP/2015/2, respectively. 

2  The Bureau of the ADP was elected in accordance with the arrangement set out in document 

FCCC/ADP/2012/2, paragraph 7, which was endorsed by decision 2/CP.18. The ADP elected the 
current members of its Bureau at the seventh part of its second session, as reflected in document 
FCCC/ADP/2014/4.

Germany,  from 17  to  19 May 2015.9 Further, the  Co-Chairs thanked the  United States of 
America for giving them an opportunity to present their emerging ideas about the structure 
of  the  June  session  on  the  margins  of  the  Major  Economies  Forum  in  Washington,  D.C., 
United States, on 19 and 20 April 2015.

I.  Opening of the session 

(Agenda item 1) 

The ninth part of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the  Durban 
1. 
Platform  for  Enhanced  Action  (ADP)  was  held  at  the  World  Conference  Center  Bonn  in 
Bonn, Germany, from 1 to 11 June 2015.1 

The  Co-Chairs  of  the  ADP,  Mr.  Ahmed  Djoghlaf  (non-Annex  I)  and  Mr.  Daniel 
2. 
Reifsnyder (Annex I), resumed the second session  of the ADP by opening its 17th plenary 
meeting on 1 June 2015. They welcomed all Parties and observers as well as Ms. Yang Liu 
(non-Annex I), Rapporteur of the ADP.2 

In order to advance the mandates and timelines agreed on at the seventeenth session 
3. 
of the Conference of the Parties (COP),3 as well as at COP 18,4 195 and 20,6 the Co-Chairs 
identified the objectives of the ninth part of the second session, namely to help to prepare a 
concise,  coherent  and  streamlined  negotiating  text  so  as  to  facilitate  negotiations  of 
substantive issues among Parties, and to provide the ADP with an opportunity to continue 
its efforts to facilitate pre-2020 climate action. 

4. 
Statements  were  made  by  representatives  of  14  Parties,  including  on  behalf  of  the 
Group  of  77  and  China,  the  Umbrella  Group,  the  European  Union  and  its  28  member 
States,  the  Environmental  Integrity  Group,  the  least  developed  countries,  the  African 
Group,  the  Alliance  of  Small  Island  States,  the  League  of  Arab  States,  the  Bolivarian 
Alliance  for  the  Peoples  of  Our  America  –  Peoples’  Trade  Treaty,  the  Independent 
Association for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Coalition for Rainforest Nations, the 
Like-minded  Developing  Countries,  the  BASIC  countries  (Brazil,  China,  India  and  South 
Africa),  and  the  Caribbean  Community.  Many  Parties  refrained  from  making  their 
statement in the room, choosing instead to make these available on the UNFCCC website, 
and thereby allowed the substantive negotiations to start without delay.7 

Also  at  the  17th  meeting,  the  Co-Chairs  invited  the  Presidency  of  COP  20  and  the 
5. 
tenth session of the Conference of the  Parties serving as the  meeting of the Parties to the 
Kyoto Protocol (CMP), the incoming Presidency of COP 21/CMP 11 and other Parties to 
inform  delegates  of  initiatives  already  undertaken  to  help  to  ensure  the  success  of 
COP 21/CMP 11. Peru reported on the informal dialogue organized by the Government of 
Peru  in  Lima,  Peru,  from  20  to  22  March  2015,  while  France  reported  on  the  informal 
consultations on the preparation of COP 21 held in Paris, France, from 6 to 8 May 2015.8 In 

1  The report on the first and second parts of the second session of the ADP is contained in document 

FCCC/ADP/2013/2; the reports on the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth parts of the second 
session are contained in documents FCCC/ADP/2013/3, FCCC/ADP/2014/1, FCCC/ADP/2014/2, 
FCCC/ADP/2014/3, FCCC/ADP/2014/4 and FCCC/ADP/2015/2, respectively. 

2  The Bureau of the ADP was elected in accordance with the arrangement set out in document 

FCCC/ADP/2012/2, paragraph 7, which was endorsed by decision 2/CP.18. The ADP elected the 
current members of its Bureau at the seventh part of its second session, as reflected in document 
FCCC/ADP/2014/4.

addition,  Germany  reported  on  the  sixth  Petersberg  Climate  Dialogue  held  in  Berlin, 
Germany,  from 17  to  19 May 2015.9 Further, the  Co-Chairs thanked the  United States of 
America for giving them an opportunity to present their emerging ideas about the structure 
of  the  June  session  on  the  margins  of  the  Major  Economies  Forum  in  Washington,  D.C., 
United States, on 19 and 20 April 2015.

II.  Organizational matters 

(Agenda item 2) 

A.  Adoption of the agenda 

(Agenda item 2(b)) 

The  agenda  for  the  second  session  of  the  ADP  was  adopted  by  the  ADP  at  the 

6. 
1st meeting of the session, on 29 April 2013.10 

B.  Organization of the work of the session 

(Agenda item 2(c)) 

At the 17th meeting, the Co-Chairs drew the delegates’ attention to the scenario note 
7. 
prepared for the ninth part of the session,11 and to their further clarification on the method 
of work for the session.12 The proposed organization of the work on agenda item 3 included 
a contact group established at the fourth part of the session,13 as well as facilitated meetings 
on  specific  issues  in  the  sections  of  the  negotiating  text  and  workstream  2.  The  ADP 
proceeded on the basis of the proposed organization of work. 

In addition, the Co-Chairs informed Parties of their intention to hold a special event 

8. 
with observers during the session. This event took place on 10 June.14 

III.  Implementation of all the elements of decision 1/CP.17 

(Agenda item 3) 

The  ADP  considered  this  agenda  item  at  its  17th  meeting,  as  well  as  at  its  18th 
9. 
meeting,  held  on  11  June.  It  had  before  it  the  negotiating  text,15  the  informal  note16  on 
overlaps  and  duplication  in  that  negotiating  text,  the  scenario  note  prepared  for  the  ninth 
part of the session, two documents containing further clarification on the mode of work  of 
the session17 and the report of the ADP on the eighth part of its second session.18

10. 
Throughout the session, Party inputs to the negotiations as well as the outputs of the 
facilitated meetings were captured and made publicly available on the UNFCCC website.19 
This  resulted  in  multiple  iterations  of  both  a  working  document  and  a  streamlined  and 
consolidated text. These were also made available on the UNFCCC website.20 

11. 
In  the  context  of  work  on  pre-2020  climate  action,  including  on  how  to  further 
advance  workstream  2,  Parties  exchanged  views  in  the  contact  group  and  in  facilitated 
meetings. The output of these meetings has been posted on the UNFCCC website.21 

12. 
Such  work  was  accompanied  by  discussions  in  the  technical  expert  meetings  on 
renewable  energy  supply  convened  on  3  June22  and  on  energy  efficiency  in  urban 
environments  convened  on  5  and  6  June,23  facilitated  by  Mr.  Amit  Kumar  (India)  and 
Ms. Sylvie Lemmet (France), respectively.  

13.  On 4 June, the ADP contact group took stock of the progress of work. The Chair of 
the  Subsidiary  Body  for  Implementation,  Mr,  Amena  Yauvoli,  represented  by  the 
Rapporteur,  Mr.  Sidat  Yaffa,24  and  the  Chair  of  the  Subsidiary  Body  for  Scientific  and 
Technological Advice, Ms. Lidia Wojtal,25 were invited to update the ADP on agenda items 
of their subsidiary bodies related to the work of the ADP.  

14. 
The ADP contact group held an additional stocktaking meeting on 8 June to further 
assess the progress made during the session. At the same meeting, the Co-Chairs provided 
Parties with guidance for work at the remainder of the session. 

15.  At its 18th meeting, the ADP had before it the revised streamlined and consolidated 
text dated 11 June 2015, the working document of the same date, as well as the Co-Chairs’ 
suggestions on the way forward for the preparation of the tenth part of the session.26  

16.  At  the  same  meeting,  Parties  agreed  that  an  additional  tool  was  needed  for  the 
preparations  for  the  tenth  part  of  the  session.  They  requested  the  Co-Chairs,  with  the 
support  of  the  secretariat  and  the  co-facilitators,  to  make  available  to  Parties  “a  single 
document based on the structure of annex II to the scenario note of 5 May 2015, guided by 
the  views  expressed  by  Parties  during  the  8  June  stocktaking  meeting,  taking  fully  into 
account  the  discussions  in  the  75  meetings  of  the  ADP  negotiating  groups  as  well  as  the 
facilitation  groups.  It  will  include  a  fully  streamlined,  consolidated,  clear  and  concise 
version of the Geneva negotiating text27 that will present clear options and will not omit or 
delete  any  option  or  position  of  Parties.  It  will  separate  paragraphs  of  the  Geneva 
negotiating text that are, by their nature, obviously appropriate for inclusion in a draft COP 
decision from paragraphs that are, by their nature, obviously appropriate for inclusion in the 
Paris  agreement.  Issues  clearly  requiring  further  substantive  negotiation  among  Parties  to 
determine  their  placement  will  remain  in  the  streamlined,  consolidated,  clear  and  concise 
Geneva negotiating text without inclusion in either category and will be clearly identified.”

administrative  and  budgetary  implications  of,  and  on  the  status  of  funding  for,  holding
